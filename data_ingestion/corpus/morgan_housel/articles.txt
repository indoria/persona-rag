A boy once asked Charlie Munger, “What advice do you have for someone like me to succeed in life?” Munger replied: “Don’t do cocaine. Don’t race trains to the track. And avoid all AIDS situations.”

It’s often hard to know what will bring joy but easy to spot what will bring misery. Building a house is complex; destroying one is simple, and I think you’ll find a similar analogy in most areas of life. When trying to get ahead it can be helpful to flip things around, focusing on how to not fall back.

Here are a few pieces of very bad advice.

Allow your expectations to grow faster than your income

Envy others’ success without having a full picture of their lives.

Pursue status at the expense of independence.

Associate net worth with self-worth (for you and others).

Mimic the strategy of people who want something different than you do.

Choose who to trust based on follower count.

Associate engagement with insight.

Let envy guide your goals.

Automatically associate wealth with wisdom.

Assume a new dopamine hit is a good indication of long-term joy.

View every conversation as a competition to win.

Assume people care where you went to school after age 25.

Assume the solution to all your problems is more money.

Maximize efficiency in a way that leaves no room for error.

Be transactional vs. relationship driven.

Prioritize defending what you already believe over learning something new.

Assume that what people can communicate is 100% of what they know or believe.

Believe that the past was golden, the present is crazy, and the future is destined for decline.

Assume that all your success is due to hard work and all your failure is due to bad luck.

Forecast with precision, certainty, and confidence.

Maximize for immediate applause over long-term reputation.

Value the appearance of looking busy.

Never doubt your tribe but be skeptical of everyone else’s.

Assume effort is rewarded more than results.

Believe that your nostalgia is accurate.

Compare your behind-the-scenes life to others’ curated highlight reel.

Discount adaptation, assuming every problem will persist and every advantage will remain

Use uncertainty as an excuse for inaction.

Judge other people at their worst and yourself at your best.

Assume learning is complete upon your last day of school.

View patience as laziness.

Use money as a scorecard instead of a tool.

View loyalty (to those who deserve it) as servitude.

Adjust your willingness to believe something by how much you want and need it to be true.

Be tribal, view everything as a battle for social hierarchy.

Have no sense of your own tendency to regret.

Only learn from your own experiences.

Make friends with people whose morals you know are beneath your own.

ARTICLE 3: Different Kinds of Smart
====================================================================================================

“The older I get the more I realize how many kinds of smart there are. There are a lot of kinds of smart. There are a lot of kinds of stupid, too.”

– Jeff Bezos

The smartest investors of all time went bankrupt 20 years ago this week. They did it during the greatest bull market of all time.

The story of Long Term Capital Management is more fascinating than sad. That investors with more academic smarts than perhaps any group before or since managed to lose everything says a lot about the limits of intelligence. It also highlights Bezos’s point: There are many kinds of smarts. We know – in hindsight – the LTCM team had epic amounts of one kind of smarts, but lacked some of the nuanced types that aren’t easily measured. Humility. Imagination. Accepting that the collective motivations of 7 billion people can’t be summarized in Excel.

“Smart” is the ability to solve problems. Solving problems is the ability to get stuff done. And getting stuff done requires way more than math proofs and rote memorization.

A few different kinds of smarts:

1. Accepting that your field is no more important or influential to other people’s decisions than dozens of other fields, pushing you to spend your time connecting the dots between your expertise and other disciplines.

Being an expert in economics would help you understand the world if the world were governed purely by economics. But it’s not. It’s governed by economics, psychology, sociology, biology, physics, politics, physiology, ecology, and on and on.

Patrick O’Shaughnessy wrote an email to his book club years ago:

Consistent with my growing belief that it is more productive to read around one’s field than in one’s field, there are no investing books on this list.

Consistent with my growing belief that it is more productive to read around one’s field than in one’s field, there are no investing books on this list.

There is so much smarts in that sentence. Someone with B+ intelligence in several fields likely has a better grasp of how the world works than someone with A+ intelligence in one field but an ignorance of that field just being one piece of a complicated puzzle.

2. A barbell personality with confidence on one side and paranoia on the other; willing to make bold moves but always within the context of making survival the top priority.

A few thoughts on this:

“The only unforgivable sin in business is to run out of cash.” – Harold Geneen“To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that is just plain foolish. If you risk something important to you for something unimportant to you, it just doesn’t make any sense.” – Buffett on the LTCM meltdown.“I think we’ve always been afraid of going out of business.” – Michael Moritz explaining Sequoia’s four decades of success.

“The only unforgivable sin in business is to run out of cash.” – Harold Geneen

“To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that is just plain foolish. If you risk something important to you for something unimportant to you, it just doesn’t make any sense.” – Buffett on the LTCM meltdown.

“I think we’ve always been afraid of going out of business.” – Michael Moritz explaining Sequoia’s four decades of success.

A key here is realizing there are smart people who may perform better than you this year or next, but without a paranoid room for error they are more likely to get wiped out, or give up, when they eventually come across something they didn’t expect. Paranoia gives your bold bets a fighting chance at surviving long enough to grow into something meaningful.

3. Understanding that Ken Burns is more popular than history textbooks because facts don’t have any meaning unless people pay attention to them, and people pay attention to, and remember, good stories.

A good storyteller with a decent idea will always have more influence than someone with a great idea who hopes the facts will speak for themselves. People often wonder why so many unthoughtful people end up in government. The answer is easy: Politicians do not win elections to make policies; they make policies to win elections. What’s most persuasive to voters isn’t whether an idea is right, but whether it narrates a story that confirms what they see and believe in the world.

It’s hard to overstate this: The main use of facts is their ability to give stories credibility. But the stories are always what persuade. Focusing on the message as much as the substance is not only a unique skill; it’s aneasy one to overlook.

4. Humility not in the idea that you could be wrong, but given how little of the world you’ve experienced you are likely wrong, especially in knowing how other people think and make decisions.

Academically smart people – at least those measured that way – have a better chance of being quickly ushered into jobs with lots of responsibility. With responsibility they’ll have to make decisions that affect other people. But since many of the smarties experienced a totally different career path than less intelligent people, they can have a hard time relating to how others think – what they’ve experienced, how they see the world, how they solve problems, what kind of issues they face, what they’re motivated by, etc. The clearest example of this is the brilliant business professor whose brain overlaps maybe a millimeter or two with the guy successfully running a local dry cleaning business. Many CEOs, managers, politicians, and regulators have the same flaw.

A subtle form of smarts is recognizing that the intelligence that gave you the power to make decisions affecting other people does not mean you understand or relate to those other people. In fact, you very likely don’t. So you go out of your way to listen and empathize with others who have had different experiences than you, despite having the authority to make decisions for them granted to you by your GPA.

5. Convincing yourself and others to forgo instant gratification,often through strategic distraction.

Everyone knows the famous marshmallow test, where kids who could delay eating one marshmallow in exchange for two later on ended up better off in life. But the most important part of the test is often overlooked. The kids exercising patience often didn’t do it through sheer will. Most kids will take the first marshmallow if they sit there and stare at it. The patient ones delayed gratification by distracting themselves. They hid under a desk. Or sang a song. Or played with their shoes. Walter Mischel, the psychologist behind the famous test, later wrote:

The single most important correlate of delay time with youngsters was attention deployment, where the children focused their attention during the delay period: Those who attended to the rewards, thus activating the hot system more, tended to delay for a shorter time than those who focused their attention elsewhere, thus activating the cool system by distracting themselves from the hot spots.

Delayed gratification isn’t about surrounding yourself with temptations and hoping to say no to them. No one is good at that. The smart way to handle long-term thinking is enjoying what you’re doing day to day enough that the terminal rewards don’t constantly cross your mind.

Thirty-seven thousand Americans died in car accidents in 1955, six times today’s rate adjusted for miles driven.

Ford began offering seat belts in every model that year. It was a $27 upgrade, equivalent to about $190 today. Research showed they reduced traffic fatalities by nearly 70%.

But only 2% of customers opted for the upgrade. Ninety-eight percent of buyers preferred to remain at the mercy of inertia.

Things eventually changed, but it took decades. Seatbelt usagewas still under 15%in the early 1980s. It didn’t exceed 80% until the early 2000s – almost half a century after Ford offered them in all cars.

It’s easy to underestimate how social norms stall change, even when the change is an obvious improvement. One of the strongest forces in the world is the urge to keep doing things as you’ve always done them, because people don’t like to be told they’ve been doing things wrong. Change eventually comes, butagonizingly slower than you might assume.

Dunkirk was a miracle. More than 330,000 Allied soldiers, pinned down by Nazi attacks, were successfully evacuated from the beaches of France back to England, ferried by hundreds of small civilian boats.

London broke out in celebration when the mission was completed. Few were more relieved than Winston Churchill, who feared the imminent destruction of his army.

But Edmund Ironside, commander of British Home Forces, pointed out that if the Allies could quickly ferry a third of a million troops from France to England while avoiding aerial attack, the Germans probably could, too. Churchill had been holding onto hope that Germany couldn’t cross the Channel with an invasion force; such a daring mission seemed impossible. But then his own army proved it was quite possible. Dunkirk was both a success and a foreboding.

Your competitors can probably innovate and execute as well as you can. So every time you uncover a new talent you’re proud of, temper your thrill with the acceptance that other people who want to win as badly as you probably aren’t far behind.

Notorious BIG once casually mentioned that he began selling crack in fourth grade. He explained:

They [teachers] was always like, “Take the talent that you have and think of something that you can do in the future with it.”And I was like, “Well, I like to draw.” So what could I do with drawing? What am I gonna be, an art dealer? I’m not gonna be that type. I was thinking maybe I can do big billboards and shit. Like commercial art.And then after that I got introduced to crack. Haha, now I’m thinking, commercial art?! Haha. I’m out here for 20 minutes and I can make some real, real money, man.

Incentives drive everything, and most of us underestimate what we’d be willing to do if the incentives were right.

When Barack Obama discussed running for president in 2005, his friend George Haywood – an accomplished investor – gave him a warning: the housing market was about to collapse, and would take the economy down with it.

George told Obama how mortgage-backed securities worked, how they were being rated all wrong, how much risk was piling up, and how inevitable its collapse was. And it wasn’t just talk: George was short the mortgage market.

Home prices kept rising for two years. By 2007, when cracks began showing, Obama checked in with George. Surely his bet was now paying off?

Obama wrote in his memoir:

George told me that he had been forced to abandon his short position after taking heavy losses.“I just don’t have enough cash to stay with the bet,” he said calmly enough, adding, “Apparently I’ve underestimated how willing people are to maintain a charade.”

George told me that he had been forced to abandon his short position after taking heavy losses.

“I just don’t have enough cash to stay with the bet,” he said calmly enough, adding, “Apparently I’ve underestimated how willing people are to maintain a charade.”

Irrational trends rarely follow rational timelines. Unsustainable things can last longer than you think.

When the Black Death plague entered England in 1348, the Scots up north laughed at their good fortune. With the English crippled by disease, now was a perfect time for Scotland to stage an attack on its neighbor.

The Scots huddled together thousands of troops in preparation for battle. Which, of course, is the worst possible move during a pandemic.

“Before they could move, the savage mortality fell upon them too, scattering some in death and the rest in panic,” historian Barbara Tuchman writes in her bookA Distant Mirror.

There’s a powerful urge to think risk is something that happens to other people. Other people get unlucky, other people make dumb decisions, other people get swayed by the seduction of greed and fear. Butyou?Me? No, never us. False confidence makes the eventual reality all the more shocking.

Some are more susceptible to risk than others, but no one is exempt from being humbled.

Dr. Dan Goodman once performed surgery on a middle-aged woman whose cataract had left her blind since childhood. The cataract was removed, leaving the woman with near-perfect vision. A miraculous success.

The patient returned for a checkup a few weeks later. The bookCrashing Throughwrites:

Her reaction startled Goodman. She had been happy and content as a blind person. Now sighted, she became anxious and depressed. She told him that she had spent her adult life on welfare and had never worked, married, or ventured far from home – a small existence to which she had become comfortably accustomed. Now, however, government officials told her that she no longer qualified for disability, and they expected her to get a job. Society wanted her to function normally. It was, she told Goldman, too much to handle.

Every goal you dream about has a downside that’s easy to overlook.

Historian John Meecham writes:

When we condemn [the past] for slavery, or for Native American removal, or for denying women their full role in the life of the nation, we ought to pause and think: What injustices are we perpetuating even now that will one day face the harshest of verdicts by those who come after us?

When we condemn [the past] for slavery, or for Native American removal, or for denying women their full role in the life of the nation, we ought to pause and think: What injustices are we perpetuating even now that will one day face the harshest of verdicts by those who come after us?

This applies to so many things.

What is the modern version of cigarettes, which were doctor-recommended just a few generations ago? We didn’t know dinosaurs existed 200 years ago, which makes you wonder what else is out there that we’re oblivious to today. What company is the modern Enron, so obviously a fraud? What do most people – not a few wackos, but most of us – believe that will look something between hilarious and disgraceful 100 years from now?

A lot of history is just gawking at how wrong, how blind, people can be. Disastrously wrong, embarrassingly blind. Millions of people, all at the same time. When you then realize that today will be considered history in a few generations … oh dear. It’s unpleasant. But also fascinating.

Apollo 11 was the first time in history humans visited another celestial body.

You’d think that would be an overwhelming experience – literally the coolest thing any human had ever done. But as the spacecraft hovered over the moon, Michael Collins turned to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and said:

It’s amazing how quickly you adapt. It doesn’t seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the moon going by, you know?

It’s amazing how quickly you adapt. It doesn’t seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the moon going by, you know?

Three months later, after Al Bean walked on the moon during Apollo 12, he turned to astronaut Pete Conrad and said “It’s kind of like the song:Is that all there is?” Conrad was relieved, because he secretly felt the same, describing his moonwalk as spectacular but not momentous.

Most mental upside comes from the thrill of anticipation – actual experiences tend to fall flat, and your mind quickly moves on to anticipating the next event. That’s how dopamine works.

If walking on the moon left astronauts underwhelmed, what does it say about our own earthly goals and expectations?

John Nash is one of the smartest mathematicians to ever live, winning the Nobel Prize. He was also schizophrenic, and spent most of his life convinced that aliens were sending him coded messages.

In her bookA Beautiful Mind, Silvia Nasar recounts a conversation between Nash and Harvard professor George Mackey:

“How could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical proof, how could you believe that extraterrestrials are sending you messages? How could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to save the world?” Mackey asked.“Because,” Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, “the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.”

“How could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical proof, how could you believe that extraterrestrials are sending you messages? How could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to save the world?” Mackey asked.

“Because,” Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, “the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.”

This is a good example of a theory I have about very talented people: No one should be shocked when people who think about the world in unique ways you like also think about the world in unique ways you don’t like. Unique minds have to be accepted as a full package.

Below is a transcript froma recent podcast I didon the tariff news.

My business that I use for my books and my speaking and whatnot is called Long Term Words, LLC. Now, the name of that is not very important. Nobody sees it unless I’m doing a talk with you or something. But let me tell you the origin behind that name, why I picked that name, because it’s relevant to today’s episode.

I’ve always wanted at least the opportunity that anything I write in a book or an article, that it has at least a fighting chance to still be relevant, 10, 20, even 50 years from now. I only want to write about things that are timeless because I’ve never enjoyed, as a reader, reading news that has an expiration date on it.

If this news article is not going to be relevant a year from now, it shouldn’t be relevant to me today. That’s always been my philosophy, and I’ve wanted to do that with my own writing. Write things that at least have a fighting chance for somebody to read and enjoy and maybe learn from many decades into the future.

That’s always been the goal. Long term words. I bring that up because today’s episode is going to be a rare departure from that in which I’m gonna talk about something that is happening in the news today and this week, and that is tariffs and the market reaction to it. We’ll get in that as well. So if that’s not your thing, if you’re only interested in the long term words, this episode might not be for you.

So before I jump into my detailed thoughts about what I think is going on, let me put my cards on the table. I think the tariffs are a terrible idea. Not just a terrible idea, but a horrendous idea.

Now I understand that all of us, everybody, including me, everybody can live in their own bubble. Particularly for these topics where it’s very hard to divorce economics and money from politics. So if you disagree with that broad view and you think the tariffs are a good idea, let me just state I respect you. I’d love to hear you. Everyone sees the world through their own unique lens, and it’s naive to assume that my lens is clearer than yours, even if it might be different.

Look, I’m a free market person. Of course. I understand the need for law and regulation and even tariffs in certain situations like masks during covid when we are reliant on other countries for things that we desperately needed, or military supplies, you don’t wanna re reliant on other countries making your military supplies in a war.

So tariffs can absolutely have their function in a well-run economy. But this what’s going on in the last week seems completely backwards, I think, to everything that we know and have learned about economics. Let me give you one analogy that’s been helpful to me with this. For nutrition science in terms of what kind of diet should you eat, what is the best diet that you and I can eat to live the healthiest life?

Nutritionists and health experts fiercely disagree on what the best diet you should eat. Should it be keto, should you be vegan? Everything in between. There’s so many different nuanced views over nutrition. But everybody agrees that eating lots of refined sugar is bad. There’s no disagreement about that. If you’re eating lots and lots of processed, refined sugar, that’s not good for you, even if there’s so much disagreement about everything else, and I think that is how economics works as well. There is so much disagreement. Among economists and politicians and investors over how to run the economy, what’s the right level of taxation?

Should it be more, should it be less? What’s the right level of regulation? Fierce disagreements among very smart people, but tariffs are the equivalent of refined sugar. You’ll be very hard pressed to find many economists. Of course, there’s always going to be one or two standouts here or there that make a lot of noise.

But one of the most agreed upon topics in economics is that tariffs are bad and trade wars are destructive. And the broad reason why is because tariffs by and large do two things. They raise prices for consumers and they make manufacturers back at home less competitive.

And one good way to explain this, I think that’s been helpful for my thinking, is just understanding the value of specialization of trade.

Now, I am a writer. I might have some skills at writing. I do not have any skills whatsoever at plumbing or electricity.

So when I need those things resolved, I hire a plumber, I hire an electrician because they are much better at those tasks than I am in that situation. When I hire a plumber, the plumber is not taking advantage of me. Even though I have a trade deficit with him, because he’s probably not buying my books, but I’m buying his services.

I have a trade deficit with the plumber. Nobody is being taken advantage of in that situation. He has a skill that I don’t, I can exchange my money for his skills. Everybody is better off. He’s better off. I’m better off.

Most people can understand that at the individual level. And that is also true at the economic level. There are some skills that the United States has that we are ridiculously good and talented at. There are other things that other nations are much better than us. And there’s no shame in that,  just in the same way that I am not shamed at the fact that I’m not good at plumbing.

It is specialization of labor. So I think in the United States historically and today, we are extremely good, I think we are the best in the world at three things, entrepreneurship, service, and very high end manufacturing like planes and, and rockets.   I think we are the best in the world at that, but just like the plumber is much better at other things than I am, there are things that other countries are way better than the United States at manufacturing a lot of certain goods, particularly mass goods, particularly lower end goods like clothing and shoes.

I spoke to A CEO last week, and he told me something that was helpful in my thinking here. He said, look, if you give instructions to Chinese workers and you say, here’s how to make this part, here’s step one, step two, step three, they are better than anyone in the world at making that part.

They can do it cheaper, faster, more efficiently, higher quality. But if you went to those Chinese workers and you said, please go design me a new part, they’re not that good at it. Americans are way better at that task than assembling that part, and that’s why the back of your iPhone says, designed in California, made in China.

That’s exactly what he was speaking to.

So look, my, my standard asterisk here, you might disagree with that. You might have different views. None of this is black and white, but the statements about it almost always are, which makes this a hard thing to talk about. So if you disagree with those views, lemme say it again. I respect you. I would listen to you. I’m just putting my cards on the table.

One big factor that I think gets lost here. And I’m gonna speak in a second why I think there is such a push among certain people for tariffs and why they think there is the need for them. I’m going to speak to that in a second, but one factor that I think is very lost here is that, yes, the United States has lost a lot of manufacturing employment over the last 50 years.

Of course, it absolutely has. And often when that is addressed, it is immediately jumped to, that’s because we ship those jobs overseas. The factories that used to be in Indiana and Tennessee and Mississippi, we shipped them to Mexico and Canada and China. There is some truth to that. Of course, indisputably. There is, I think, a bigger truth that gets lost, which is that where a lot of those jobs went was not necessarily to another country, it was to automation.

My favorite example of this, I wrote this 10 years ago, I had to go fish this up from an old article that I wrote is about a US steel factory in Gary, Indiana. In 1950, this individual factory produced 6 million tons of steel with 30,000 workers. In 2010 it produced seven and a half million tons of steel with 5,000 workers. So during this period, they increased the amount of steel that they were making, and they did it with 25,000 fewer workers. They went from 30,000 workers to 5,000. That story, I think, can be repeated across virtually everything that is made in the United States and around the world over the last 50 years.

Very interesting thing that I read the other day: China, the manufacturing powerhouse of the globe, has fewer manufacturing workers today than they did 10 years ago. They’re making more stuff than ever before. They’re building factories faster than ever before, and they have fewer people working in those factories because China, more than anybody else probably throughout history, is installing and using robots and automation in their manufacturing at a ferocious pace.

And so you can keep making more and more stuff but you need fewer and fewer people working on those assembly lines. That is often lost in the debate because if we were to bring back the manufacturing capacity to the United States, and that’s a separate debate, that’s a much longer debate, but let’s say that we do, it would not in any circumstances bring back the manufacturing jobs and the employment levels that we had in the 1950s. It’s a very different world today than it was back then. One way to get a very good view of this is to go onto YouTube and search for a video of Tesla factories. Because Tesla, very similar to China, is  big on automation in its assembly and robots. And compare a modern Tesla factory to the 1950s Ford assembly line. It could not be more night and day, it could not be more different. The modern assembly line is robots and machines.  Versus the assembly line back in the 1950s, which was biceps and backs and legs. That today has been replaced by automation.

One other example of this in the auto industry in 1990, not that long ago, the average American auto worker like working on an assembly line, their share of total auto production was about seven vehicles per year. So take the number of vehicles that were produced in the United States, divide that by the number of auto workers, and it was about seven.

The average worker was responsible for seven vehicles per year by 2023. Again, that’s just like one generation apart. Not even that much. The average auto worker in the United States was responsible for producing 33 vehicles per year. It went from seven to 33.

So we are, we are still producing a lot of cars in the United States. We still make a lot of vehicles here in the United States. It just does not require the amount of labor that it used to.

Just a few years ago, the economics journalist Neil Irwin wrote,  “in the newest factories, one can look across an airplane hangar size floor, and see only a small handful of technicians staring at computer screens, monitoring the work of the machines. Workers lifting and pushing and riveting are nowhere to be seen.” And so I think that that is how manufacturing works today. It is very high output and low head count. At least much lower than it used to be.

So even as a US faces a manufacturing boom, which it has by the way in the last decade, easy to overlook, that manufacturing just can’t be expected to create the kind of employment that you saw many decades ago.

Okay, so that is a good leadway into another topic, which is about what the world was like during the golden ages of manufacturing that we remember, you know, the people who are working in the auto plants and the steel mills in the 1950s and the 1960s and through the 1970s, I think that is by and large the world that a lot of people want to go back to. Very understandable. I do not look down upon them for wanting to go back to that world in the slightest because it was a great world. It was amazing when there were tens of millions of manufacturing jobs in the industrial parts of the United States.

The people who did not go to college, or even people who did, could go get and earn good wages, that was great. It was a wonderful thing, but lemme tell you at least part of why it occurred at the time. At the end of World War II in 1945, Europe and Japan were decimated into rubble. Whereas the United States, of course, had all of its manufacturing capacity intact and had all these gis coming home.

There were 16 million GIs who came home in 1945 and had all this pent up demand to buy homes and washing machines and cars and all the new gadgets. And because Europe and Japan were in rubble, America, by and large had global manufacturing to itself. It had like a monopoly on global manufacturing at the time because Europe and Japan was still trying to build themselves back from the devastation of the war.

China at this period was still kind of an economic backwater, wasn’t really part of the equation. It was also trying to recover from the ravages of World War II. Places like India and Bangladesh and Thailand that manufacture a lot today weren’t really part of the global manufacturing equation back then.

There was this period when, because of the state of  global geopolitics, America had a manufacturing dominance to itself for a good 20 years from probably 1945 through the end of the 1960s. That was also a period when, for many different factors, we don’t need to go into all of them, but white collar workers were not making that much money.

If you worked on Wall Street in the 1970s, that was not a place to make a lot of money. That was an admin accounting job that was not very looked highly upon because you didn’t make that much money. Bankers were  not making nearly the kind of money that they made in the decades before or after. This period, and that was important because the blue collar manufacturing workers, by comparison to others in the economy, to others in their town, were doing great.

So even if their wages were lower back then than they would be today, even adjusted for inflation, when the manufacturing worker compared themself to the banker or the accountant, or the lawyer or the doctor, by comparison, he said, I’m doing pretty great. I’m doing pretty well. And then two things happened starting around the 1970s that really accelerated in the eighties and nineties, which was one Japan and Europe kind of after having recovered from the ravages of World War II became manufacturing powerhouses in their own right.

One of the first signs of this was when Honda, Nissan and Toyota started selling cars in the United States, and people realized in the US that, Hey, actually. These are pretty good cars. These aren’t bad. It was easy to look down upon ‘em at first because they were small and had tiny little engines relative to the Chevy Camaro or the,  the T-Bird, but this came during a period in the seventies and eighties when gas prices surged and all of a sudden those tiny little engines in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla we’re what people wanted. And then all of a sudden, out of the blue, you went from incredible American dominance in car manufacturing from gm, Ford, and Chrysler to Honda, Toyota, and Nissan actually taking a lot of market share.

There’s a very good book I read a couple months ago. It’s called The Reckoning,  and it’s about Ford’s decline and Nissan’s rise during this period,  from the 1950s to the 1990s. And a lot of what happened to, to state it very generally, it’s more complicated than this, was companies like Ford, a GM in Chrysler, had so much dominance during this period, fifties, sixties, seventies, that when they started facing competition from foreign imports in the eighties and nineties,  they kind of lost their way.  They had such a stranglehold monopoly on auto manufacturing that they became much less competitive. And as I said earlier, that is one function that tariffs implement is when you don’t have to compete with foreign suppliers.

You become much less competitive. You become kind of fat and happy and lazy. In a way, and that was kind of the, the broad thesis of this book was that Ford became fat, happy, and lazy while Nissan and other Japanese auto manufacturers were just surging.

And so the manufacturing dominance, not just in autos but in lots of things, heavy machinery and whatnot, started to erode in the seventies, eighties, and nineties, and really started to explode higher in the two thousands when China really came on board in terms of global manufacturing. And that occurred at the same moment when white collar workers.

And finance and accounting and office jobs started making fortunes huge sums of money. So now at the same moment that the manufacturing worker was losing their jobs both to automation and foreign competition, the white collar workers were, were just having a field day and making money hand over fist, which made what manufacturing jobs existed feel even worse by comparison because let’s say you’re an auto worker making $25 an hour in one era, that might feel great, but if all of a sudden your neighbor who is a project manager at KPMG is making 300 grand a year, your $25 an hour doesn’t feel that great anymore. ‘cause your neighbor has, has a bigger house and more cars and is sending their kids to private school.

So by comparison, you feel worse off even if your wages adjusted for inflation may have been going up. And so you put all of that together. That is a very. Shorthand history. Of course, there are a billion variables that I left out in there, but I think that shorthand history is in broad strokes what has happened over the last 80 years.

It is so understandable that  you have millions of workers who say, this economy worked for me 50 years ago and it doesn’t today. My dad, my grandpa had great jobs in the GM factory and I can’t have that today. So understandable that that would be the thought process of millions of workers, and I think it is naive and insulting for people who are on my side of the tariff debate who say tariffs are a bad idea who cannot understand the views of those kind of people. Because if I was in that situation, and if lots of people who disagree with tariffs were in that situation, they’d be arguing for the same thing.

I think one of America’s strengths over time, this has been true for hundreds of years, is this sounds kind of crazy, but I think it’s true. A firm belief in things that are probably not true. That has always been a strength of the United States. This goes back to the very early days of the settlers and the colonizers, whom back in Europe were told that America was a land of absolute abundance.

And when you got there, there would be just, you know, rivers overflowing with gold and whatnot. And actually it was like a malaria swap when they got to the East coast of the United States. But we believed it was always believed that this was the promise land. That was what brought the people over. And even when they came to the United States and settled. It was that belief too. America has always been so unbelievably optimistic, particularly at the individual level, and that’s why I think we’re so good at entrepreneurship. It’s this idea that you, the entrepreneur, even if you start as a, nobody can make it to become the next Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison. You can make it. You can do it. Not a lot of other cultures have that level of even like optimistic ignorance, because in many ways that’s what it is. But what that’s done is it’s created this incredible entrepreneurial society that has given us and the world some incredible world changing innovations in companies over the years.

And when I pair that belief with the observation that there are tens of millions of Americans who feel like the world doesn’t work for them anymore, who feels like this economy is not working for them anymore. That worries me. It worries me that a meaningful chunk of society does not have that optimistic ignorance. I mean that in a positive sense to think that, hey, the world is my oyster. The sky is the limit. I can go do it now. We’ve been through similar periods in the past, the 1930s, the 1970s, and we recovered from those. We recovered from those malaise periods, and I’m optimistic that we’ll recover from it this time, but we should not lose track of the fact that we are in one of those periods again.

Where this goes next, my guess is as good as yours. And both of our guesses are useless beacuse I don’t think anyone knows what’s gonna happen next. Interestingly, many of you will listen to this podcast the day that I publish it, which I guess is April 8th. Some of you will listen to it weeks in the future when half of what I just said will be outdated because the situation is changing so quickly.

That gets back to why I only want to do long-term words and why this is so against what I normally do. But let me say a couple of things about. Investing because that has been the initial reaction to the tariffs has been entirely in the stock market, which as I speak here, is down about 20% or so from its highs that were reached just a couple weeks ago.

Now, the tariff impact has not hit the broader economy in terms of inflation at the grocery store or mass layoffs or whatnot. But so far it’s been in the stock market. So even if that is a very minor part of what will impact the economy, let me speak to that just a bit. I, of course have, have been glued to Twitter over the last week just trying to understand what’s happening and hear other people’s views.

I’ve watched it with a sense of shock and just confusion trying to piece together what’s happened, but it has not in the slightest changed how I invest, and I extremely doubt that it ever will. I think it is possible to be an engaged and informed citizen, even a social media junkie reading the news and a calm investor at the same time.

I purchased stocks early last week, not because of anything that was going on in the news, but because you gotta do that every month around the first of the month. I do it every single month. I’ve done that for, uh, I don’t know, 20 years now. I’ll do it next month. I’ll do it the month after that. That won’t change. I think it, it never changes. So I think you can simultaneously dollar cost average. Remain long-term, optimistic,  not panic about anything that’s going on in the world. You can enjoy life, spend time outdoors, hang out with your kids, eat good food, listen to good music, have a good time, and at the same time, if you are of the same belief of me, realize how destructive and unnecessary what we’re going through is.

You can do all of that at the same time. It’s not like you have to be optimistic or pessimistic. I am very optimistic on the long term, even if I think this is a bad idea, that’s not a contradiction. Something else I’ve been thinking about is that we have in the past been through much more uncertain times than we’re going through right now, but it never feels that way, or it rarely feels that way because when we think about the past economic crises,  COVID, Lehman Brothers, 9/11, Pearl Harbor, those kind of events. We know how the story ended and we know that the story did end and we know that we eventually recovered. But whenever it is a current crisis, a current period of uncertainty, you don’t know that. You don’t know when it’s going to end. You don’t know how it’s gonna end, and some people don’t know if it will ever end.

And because of that, even if, I think without a doubt what we’re going through is less uncertain, less serious than other periods of economic upheaval. It rarely feels that way because we don’t know what’s gonna happen next. So every crisis has its own little unique flavor of what’s going on. But the common denominator is this feeling that you can’t see the future anymore. And that makes people go crazy in, turns them into political junkies. It makes ‘em make bad investing decisions. That’s always been the case. Try to avoid that. I would also say that for most investors, 99% of good investing is doing nothing.

Most investing is just not doing anything, not trading, not selling. Just letting your money sit there and to hopefully grow over the years and decades. That’s 99% of good investing. 1% of good investing is how you behave when the world is going crazy. And this, I think, is one of those periods when the market falls 20% in a week.

That is one of those periods when it is so absolutely vital that you keep your head on straight. A lot of people will mix their investing decisions with their political beliefs, and 99% of the time, that is a mistake that you are not gonna make good investing decisions if you are doing it through the lens of your tribal beliefs.

Whatever those beliefs might be. Napoleon’s definition of a military genius was quote, the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind. I’m gonna repeat that because it is such a ridiculously good quote. A military genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.

It is the exact same in investing to be a good investor over time. You don’t need to make a lot of genius decisions. You just need to be merely average when everyone else is making bad decisions, as many people are.

One other thing that’s very different from this period, these, this tariff period that we’re going through, if you compare it to other periods of economic upheaval like Covid and Lehman Brothers and 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, is that this could end. In the next hour, right? Like the, these tariffs could be immediately removed in the next hour.

Or even if it’s not that there could be certain laws, whether it’s from the courts or from Congress, that could end these very quickly. Obviously we didn’t have that with Covid. There was no button on anyone’s desk that said, remove the virus, just click this button. We do have that now.

And so what is very different about this is how quickly it could end, and if that were to happen, how ferocious. The rally in stock markets would almost certainly be, even if there was some permanent damage, because global trading partners don’t trust us as much as they used to this, as such a unique period of economic crisis because with the flip of the switch and the stroke of the pen or a single tweet, it could all end.

And I don’t think I can’t think of another economic crisis that was similar to that. Obviously that was, there’s no analogy for that in terms of 9/11 or Pearl Harbor or whatever. The other thing I would state, maybe I’ll end with this, is that in every period of economic upheaval and political upheaval, it is so easy to underestimate the counter forces that come from it.

When things are declining, when things are getting worse in your eyes, it is easy to extrapolate and say, well, it’s gonna keep getting worse forever. It’s very difficult to envision the counter forces of. People’s reactions and lower stock market valuations that push in the other direction. It is true in every single previous bear market that those counter forces set the seeds for the next bull market, but virtually nobody saw them coming at the time.

That lower valuations plant the seeds of the next bull market, that people becoming frustrated with this political environment. Push for change. It’s always difficult to see those, but they always happen. That is happening right now at this moment. There are counter forces all over the place that are setting up the next bull market.

Now, I have no idea when that’s gonna begin. It might start tomorrow. It might start six years from now. I have no idea, but it’s always in play and it’s easy to overlook and it leaves people more pessimistic than they should be. And so as I end this rant, that will be a departure from what I normally write and speak about,

I’ll end just by saying I’m as optimistic as I’ve ever been, particularly for the long term. I’ve always talked about the idea of rational optimism, which is the idea that I am very optimistic that the world is gonna be a better, wealthier place 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now, but I’m rational in the belief that it’s gonna be very difficult between now and then.

The path between now and then will be extremely difficult. I wrote about that many years ago, and as I sit here in this unique week, unique period, maybe that’s the belief that I always come back to. Very optimistic about the long term, even if I’m understandable about how difficult it will be to get there.

I heard a phrase recently: “Magazine architect.”

It’s a derisive term architects use for their colleagues who design buildings that look beautiful, grace magazine covers, and win awards, but lack functionality for the tenants.

Intricate roofs look amazing – and are notorious nightmares for leaking.

Oddly shaped buildings win awards – and offer little flexibility to remodel interior layouts.

Fancy materials glisten—but good luck finding someone skilled enough to maintain or replace them.

Ornate lobbies take up tremendous space – and are often not used by occupants, who enter through the garage.

The bookHow Buildings Learnwrites that architects fancy themselves as artists, but people who occupy buildings do not want art; they want a building to work in:

Art must experiment to do its job. Most experiments fail. Art costs extra. How much extra are you willing to pay to live in a failed experiment? Art flouts convention. Convention became conventional because it works. Aspiring to art means aspiring to a building that almost certainly cannot work, because the old good solutions are thrown away. The roof has a dramatic new look, and it leaks dramatically.

Convention became conventional because it works. Aspiring to art means aspiring to a building that almost certainly cannot work, because the old good solutions are thrown away. The roof has a dramatic new look, and it leaks dramatically.

The book cites renowned architects like I.M. Pei and Frank Lloyd Wright for designing buildings admired by everyone except their occupants, whose feelings tend towards frustration and disgust. Frank Lloyd Wright once said of his infamously leaky roofs: “If the roof doesn’t leak, the architect hasn’t been creative enough” – an amusing comment to everyone but thoseliving in his homes.

The flip side is that office buildings with happy tenants tend to be big, boring, rectangles built with classic materials. They will win no awards and grace no magazines. But the roof is tight, the layout is flexible, and the HVAC system is located where it should be. The true purpose of a building – a place that helps you do your best work – is achieved.

I like art and can appreciate architecture. But the idea that there is a time and place for beautiful vs. practical should be recognized. And the idea that if you are looking for practical advice, beware hiring an artist whose goal is to be praised should be, too.

Is that true for many things in life?

Jason Zweigonce wroteabout investing:

While people need good advice, what they want is advice that sounds good.The advice that sounds the best in the short run is always the most dangerous in the long run. Everyone wants the secret, the key, the roadmap to the primrose path that leads to El Dorado: the magical low-risk, high-return investment that can double your money in no time. Everyone wants to chase the returns of whatever has been hottest and to shun whatever has gone cold.

Everyone wants to chase the returns of whatever has been hottest and to shun whatever has gone cold.

A lot of financial advice is beautiful and intelligent but has no practical purpose for the person receiving it.

It happens for a couple reasons.

One is that, like architects, financial professionals may want to further their career more than they want to help their clients. I think this is usually innocent: It’s easy to be blind to what your clients need when your business is so profitable and you’re gaining so much attention.

“Look how much money I’m making and how often I’m asked to come on TV” can be interpreted as “I am adding so much value.” Sometimes that’s true; often it’s not. An intense and complex derivatives strategy can make you sound brilliant and bring in buckets of fees, and also be the opposite of what a client actually needs. It’s telling that the company that figured out how to provide low-cost index funds – Vanguard – could only do itas a non-profit. There’s a mile-wide gap between what many clients need and what generates the most fees. A lot of people need the financial equivalent of a rectangle building but are sold a gorgeous geodesic dome with a leaky roof and no garage.

The other reason is that no two people are alike, and financial advice that’s useful for you could be disastrous for me and vice versa. There is no one-size-fits-all financial plan – a fact that’s easy to overlook because people want to think of finance like it’s physics, with clean formulas and absolute answers. When advice needs to be personal but you think it’s universal, it’s common to default to what sounds the best, the most intelligent, and the most complex. People drift from practical towards beautiful.

I watch financial markets every day because I think they’re a window into culture and behavior. They’re so fascinating, so beautiful, like art. But my personal finances are simple and boring. They will win no awards. But they’re practical for me and my family. They provide what I need them to do. Isn’t there beauty in that?

ARTICLE 13: Pure Independence
====================================================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FULL TEXT:
byMorgan Housel@morganhousel

A simple formula for a pretty nice life is independence plus purpose.

Purpose is different for everyone. Sometimes it’s family, sometimes it’s community, religion, work, whatever.

But independence is more universal. Our desire to be independent, why we want it, what prevents us from achieving it, and why some people sabotage their ability to have it, is such a common story across cultures and generations.

I have a parenting story.

My son has always been shy. Painfully shy. At times it’s adorable; at times my wife and I worry. Pre-school teachers gave up trying to get him to participate in group activities – he would sit by himself in the corner watching other kids play. He wouldn’t trick-or-treat one year because the thought of knocking on a stranger’s door could bring him to tears. We almost didn’t make it through airport security once because he refused to tell the TSA agent his age (he was eight).

But we had confidence he’d improve. And like most kids, he has.

Last week we were at a pool and he asked if he could get ice cream. I said yes, but you have to do it by yourself. You have to order it yourself, hand her the money, take the change – all of it. I’m not even going to be nearby.

“I can’t do it,” he said.

“That’s OK, you don’t have to” I said.

He paused.

“But can I still get ice cream?”

“Yes, but you have to do it yourself,” I said.

Another pause.

“What if I get in trouble?” he asked.

“For what?”

“What if they tell me no because I’m a kid?”

“They won’t. But even if they do, it’s fine,” I said. “You won’t be in trouble.”

I could see the gears turning in his head. He wanted to do it so badly.

“I don’t know,” he said. “I’m so scared.”

Another pause.

“I can’t do it.”

It’s difficult as a parent to, on one hand, want to shower your kids with protection and help while, on the other, know how important it is to teach them independence. “Teach” is probably the wrong word, because you know they’ll figure it out on their own. Sometimes you provide the most help with the assistance you withhold.

My son walked off. I had no idea what he was going to do.

A few minutes later he came back – absolutely beaming – with a bowl of ice cream.

This story might seem benign to other parents – or even bizarre if you’re used to a gregarious kid. But in the context of his past, it’s hard to describe its impact. He was so proud of himself.

If I had gone with him and held his hand through the process, the ice cream would have given him a small happiness boost. When he did it on his own terms, with a sense of independence, the psychological rewards were off the charts.

I’ll tell you the takeaway: If you’re used to being assisted, supervised, mandated, or dictated, and then suddenly you experience the glory of independence, the feeling is sensational.Doing something on your own terms can feel better than doing the exact same thing when someone else is peering over your shoulder, telling you what to do, guiding you along.

And that’s as true for adults as it is for kids getting ice cream.

Independence is the best financial goal for most people. But independence is more than just financial – moral, cultural, and intellectual independence – is one of the highest levels you can reach in life. “There is only one success,” says poet Christopher Morley, “to be able to spend your life in your own way.”

Derek Sivers once put it a different way:

All misery comes from dependency. If you weren’t dependent on income, people, or technology, you would be truly free. The only way to be deeply happy is to break all dependencies.

All misery comes from dependency. If you weren’t dependent on income, people, or technology, you would be truly free. The only way to be deeply happy is to break all dependencies.

That’s why independence – financially, intellectually, morally – is one of the highest goals you can achieve.

Here are a few things I’ve thought about with independence.

1. Independence is the only way to recognize individuality.

I read this great quote recently from an early Amazon employee:

Jeff [Bezos] said many times that if we wanted Amazon to be a place where builders can build, we needed to eliminate communication, not encourage it.

Jeff [Bezos] said many times that if we wanted Amazon to be a place where builders can build, we needed to eliminate communication, not encourage it.

The idea is that if you want to do something great, you cannot have a group of people constantly telling you what you’re doing wrong and why it doesn’t mesh with their own goals. That’s not because those other people might be wrong; it’s because they might be playing a different game than you are.

In business, finance, and everyday life, a great decision for me might be a terrible decision for you and vice versa. If everyone had the same goals, the same family dynamics, and the same personalities, we could make finance a hard science and say, “Here’s how everyone should save and invest.” But it’s not like that. The difference in how you and I want to live our lives – what our own definition of success might be – can be 10 miles wide. A potato farmer and a hedge fund manager might be equally happy, all while looking at the other as if from a different planet.

A lot of financial mistakes come from decisions that would be right for someone else but wrong for you. They are the most dangerous, because smart people around you say, “This worked for me. It changed my life. You should do it too.”

Here’s another thing I read recently, from G. K. Chesterton:

Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are least dangerous is the man of ideas. He is acquainted with ideas, and moves among them like a lion-tamer. Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are most dangerous is the man of no ideas. The man of no ideas will find the first idea fly to his head like wine to the head of a teetotaller.

Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are least dangerous is the man of ideas. He is acquainted with ideas, and moves among them like a lion-tamer. Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are most dangerous is the man of no ideas. The man of no ideas will find the first idea fly to his head like wine to the head of a teetotaller.

If you have no strong views on what kind of life you want to live – who are you, what you desire, what makes you happy and what doesn’t – you’re likely to want to mimic the most visually appealing person you come across (often the person with the biggest house, fastest car, or nicest clothes). That may work, it may not.

And so it’s vital to constantly reflect on who you want to be, what kind of life you want to live, and ask if you’re on an independent path versus chasing someone else’s dream.

2. Independence in thought, philosophy, morals, and culture are as important as financial independence.

Charlie Munger once listed three practical rules for success:

Don’t sell something you wouldn’t buy.Work for people you admire.Partner with people you enjoy.

Don’t sell something you wouldn’t buy.

Work for people you admire.

Partner with people you enjoy.

So simple.

I have seen many people achieve some level of financial independence only to be sucked into a new kind of dependence: the culture of their tribe. Financial freedom is achieved, but it’s replaced with sycophancy to a new boss, or a blind adherence to tribal views you might disagree with deep down.

It’s a unique form of poverty: rather than needing to work for money, you are indebted to needing to think a certain way.

I once heard a good litmus test: If I can predict your views on one topic by hearing your views about another, unrelated topic, you are not thinking independently. Example: If your views on immigration allow someone to accurately predict your views on abortion and gun control, there’s a good chance you’re not thinking independently.

There are so many different versions of this: The salesman who doesn’t believe in his products, the worker who secretly thinks her boss is crazy, the employee who can’t stand his highest-paying client, the voter who nods along while wincing inside.

There’s a difference between the practical need to accept different views and pretending to agree with different views, especially if you’re just doing it for more money.

Investor Ed Thorp once said: “It is vastly less stressful to be independent—and one is never independent when involved in a large structure with powerful clients.”

Less stress is a good point. It’s mentally exhausting to pretend to be someone you’re not. It’s part of why so many people look forward to retirement: it may be the first time in their professional lives they can truly be themselves.

Financial independence is easy to grasp – you no longer rely on others for income. Intellectual and moral independence is more nuanced, but not having it is a unique form of debt.

3. When you’re independent you feel less desire to impress strangers, which can be an enormous financial and psychological cost.

Speaking of hidden forms of debts: How much of what takes place in our modern economy is done purely for signaling reasons? It’s impossible to quantify, but you know it when you see it. And taking an action to impress other people is a direct form of dependence. It happens in many different ways:

Physical signaling(clothes, cars, homes, jewelry)

Clout-chasing(desperate for social media engagement)

Tribal signaling(political battles, status superiority, election bumper stickers)

Moral signaling(everything is us-versus-them)

Each of these is about measuring your own value through the opinions of others. Sometimes it’s direct (your net worth versus mine) and other times it’s more subtle (do you like me?). The person who is desperate for attention and acceptance from a group of strangers is hardly different from the person begging for money on the street.

The wild thing about all this effort is how easy it is to overestimate how much other people are thinking about you. No one is thinking about you as much as you are. They are too busy thinking about themselves.

Even when people are thinking about you, they often do it just to contextualize their own life. When someone looks at you and thinks, “I like her sweater,” what they actually may be thinking is, “That sweater would look nice on me.” I once called this the man-in-the-car-paradox: When you see someone driving a nice car, rarely do you think, “Wow, that driver is cool.” What you think is, “If I drove that car, people would think I’m cool.” Do you see the irony?

When you’re truly independent you rid yourself of this silly burden. It can be such a relief when you do. Only when you stop caring what strangers might think of you do you realize how much effort you may have previously put into their validation.

But let me make an equally important point:

4. Independence does not mean you don’t care what anyone thinks of you. It means that you strategically decide whose attention you seek.

I need the love and admiration of my wife, kids, and parents. I enjoy the presence and camaraderie of about five friends. I want to foster relationships with a small group of people I admire in my professional orbit.

But you can see how this funnel keeps tapering off from there.

When you independently choose who you want to include in your small circle of life, the actions you take, the work you pursue, and even the values you hold can completely flip. Rather than trying to appease everyone (foolish, impossible) you select the life you want to live and focus your attention on a smaller group of people whose love and support you deeply desire.

It’s the opposite of when business leaders and politicians pander for the support of the masses. On one hand you can say they are doing something that gets them what they want (power). On the other, how independent are you if the words you say and the actions you take are dictated by the beliefs of a group of people you’ve never met?

A related point here is that loyalty to those who deserve your loyalty is a wonderful thing. Family, genuine friends, companies who you deeply respect and admire – it can be so satisfying to offer your loyalty to someone who deserves it. But it’s rare, and only when you’re independent can you be honest about whether you’re being appropriately loyal or attached to the attention and money of people you secretly don’t admire.

5. Financial independence doesn’t mean you stop working.

This idea is related to the previous one: Financial independence is a wonderful goal. But achieving it doesn’t necessarily mean you stop working – just that you choose the work you do, when you do it, for how long, and whom you do it with.

Those who retire early tend to come from one of two camps:

They hated their work but kept doing it to make as much money as they could.

They enjoyed their work but quit when they had enough money.

To each their own, but both look like situations where money controls your decisions. The irony is that some people who think they’re financially independent are actually completely dependent on money, so much so that they spend their days doing things they’d rather not because money tells them they should. Rather than using money as a tool, the money used them.

6. Being independent doesn’t mean you’re accountable to no one. You become accountable to yourself, which is often when you do your best work.

Study any great creator – scientists, artists, entrepreneurs – and you’ll find an independent drive. They weren’t working to appease a boss or earn a paycheck; they were driven solely by their own curiosity and expectations.

When you’re working for someone else’s expectations, the path of least resistance is to put in the minimum required effort – or, worse, to give off the appearance of effort while not actually being productive.

I think almost everyone is creative. But it’s often hard to dredge up creativity when you’re doing it for someone else. In my profession: Writing for yourself is fun, and it shows. Writing for other people is work, and it shows. You do your best work when you’re doing it on your own terms.

I bet that applies to most fields.

And actually most of life.

A day after the September 11th terrorist attacks, every member of Congress stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitoland sangGod Bless America.

Could you imagine that happening today? It’s easy to say no, given how nasty politics has become. But if America faced an existential crisis like 9/11 again, I think you’d see the same kind of unity return.There’s a long historyof enemies putting their differences aside when facing a big, devastating threat. People get serious when shit gets real.

If that sounds like wishful thinking to you, let me propose a reason why: Part of the reason today’s world is so petty and angry is because life is currently pretty good for a lot of people.

There are no domestic wars.

Unemployment is low.

Household wealthis at anall-time high.

Innovation is astounding.

It’s far from perfect, and even an optimist could list hundreds of problems and injustices. A pessimist could do worse.

But let me put it this way: As the world improves, our threshold for complaining drops.

In the absence of big problems, people shift their worries to smaller ones. In the absence of small problems, they focus on petty or even imaginary ones.

Most people – and definitely society as a whole – seem to have a minimum level of stress. They will never be fully at ease because after solving every problem the gaze of their anxiety shifts to the next problem, no matter how trivial it is relative to previous ones.

Free from stressing about where their next meal will come from, worry shifts to, say, a politician being rude. Relieved of the trauma of war, stress shifts to whether someone’s language is offensive, or whether the stock market is overvalued.

Imagine a fictional society that has unlimited wealth, unlimited health, and permanent peace. Would they be overflowing with joy? Probably not. I think their defining characteristic would be how trivial and absurd their grievances would be. They’d be enraged that their maid was 10 minutes late, stressed about whether their lawn was green enough, or despondent that their child didn’t get into Harvard.

Psychologist Nick Haslam once described what he calledConcept Creep. It’s when the definition of a problem expands beyond its original boundaries. It often gives the impression that the world is getting worse when what’s changed is our definition of what counts as a problem. It happens two ways:

- Things previously considered normal are redefined as risks. Like a child being bullied at school, or mild anxiety being diagnosed as mental illness.

- Less severe instances of a risk are recast as major risks. Like having to delay retirement from age 65 to age 67.

In each case, the world can get better but people don’t feel it – they can even feel like they’re going backwards – because once a problem is solved it’s replaced by a new one, often with the same level of anxiety, fear, and anger.

A few things I keep in mind:

In a way, the best definition of progressis when you’ve knocked out the major issues and are left dealing with lower, less-severe ones.

Stress is an innovator. Nothing incentivizes like worry, so we should never want a world where people see everything as perfect.

People are problem solvers. It’s a great characteristic and the source of all progress. But when solving problems is core to your identity, you occasionally see trouble where none exists.

Being angry can be an intoxicating feeling. It offers a sense of moral superiority, because when you accuse others of causing problems, you’re implying that you are better than them. It feels great, and in a strange way some people love being pissed off.

The dumber the disagreements, the better the world actually is.

They’re relevant to everyone, and apply to lots of things:

Who has the right answersbut I ignore because they’re not articulate?

What haven’t I experienced firsthand that leaves me naive to how something works?As Jeff Immelt said, “Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.”

Which of my current views would I disagree withif I were born in a different country or generation?

What do I desperately want to be true, so much that I think it’s true when it’s clearly not?

What is a problem that I think only applies to other countries/industries/careersthat will eventually hit me?

What do I think is truebut is actually just good marketing?

What looks unsustainablebut is actually a new trend we haven’t accepted yet?

What has been true for decades that will stop working, but will drag along stubborn adherents because it had such a long track record of success?

Who do I think is smartbut is actually full of it?

What do I ignorebecause it’s too painful to accept?

How would my views change if I had 10,000 years of good, apples-to-apples dataon things I only have recent history to study?

Which of my current views would changeif my incentives were different?

What are we ignoring todaythat will seem shockingly obvious in a year?

What events very nearly happenedthat would have fundamentally changed the world I know if they had occurred?

How much have things outside of my controlcontributed to things I take credit for?

How do I knowif I’m being patient (a skill) or stubborn (a flaw)? They’re hard to tell apart without hindsight.

Who do I look up tothat is secretly miserable?

After college, my wife (who was then my girlfriend) and I got an apartment in the Seattle suburbs. It was amazing – a perfect location, a beautiful apartment, even had a view of the lake. The economy was such a wreck at the time that we paid almost nothing for it.

A few months ago I reminisced to my wife about how awesome that time was. We were 23, gainfully employed, living in our version of the Taj Mahal. This was before kids, so we slept in until 10am on the weekends, went for a walk, had brunch, took a nap, and went out for dinner. That was our life. For years.

“That was peak living, as good as it gets,” I told her.

“What are you talking about?” she said. “You were more anxious, scared, and probably depressed then than you’ve ever been.”

Of course, she was right.

If I think deeper than the initial knee-jerk memory, I remember being miserable. I was overwhelmed with career anxieties, terrified that I wouldn’t make it, worried I was about to be fired. For good reason: I was bad at my job. I was insecure. I was nervous about relationships being fragile.

In my head, today, I look back and think, “I must have been so happy then. Those were my best years.” But in reality, at the time, I was thinking, “I can’t wait for these years to end.”

There’s a Russian saying about nostalgia: “The past is more unpredictable than the future.” It’s so common for people’s memories about a time to become disconnected from how they actually felt at the time.

I have a theory for why this happens: When studying history, you know how the story ends, which makes it impossible to imagine what people were thinking or feeling in the past.

When thinking about our own lives, we don’t remember how we actually felt in the past; We remember how we think we should have felt, given what we know today.

I remember myself as being happier than I was because today, looking back, I know that most of the things I was worried about never happened. I didn’t get laid off, the career turned out fine, the relationships endured. Islayed some demons. Even the things that were hard and didn’t end up like I wanted, I got over.

I know that now.

But I didn’t know that at the time.

So when I look back, I see a kid who had nothing to worry about. Even if, at the time, all I did was worry.

It’s hard to remember how you felt when you know how the story ends.

I was recently asked at a conference how investors should feel about the stock market given that it’s basically gone straight up over the last 15 years.

My first thought was: you’re right. If you started investing 15 years ago and checked your account for the first time, you would gasp. You’ve made a fortune.

Then I thought, wait a minute.Straight up for the last 15 years?To echo my wife: What are you talking about?

Are we going to pretend like the 22% crash in the summer of 2011 never happened?

Are we supposed to forget that stocks plunged more than 20% in 2016, and again in 2018?

Are we –hello?– now pretending that the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression didn’t happen in 2020?

That Europe’s banking system nearly collapsed?

That wages were stagnant?

That America’s national debt was downgraded?

Are we now forgetting that at virtually every moment of the last 15 years, smart people argued that the market was overvalued, recession was near, hyperinflation was around the corner, the country was bankrupt, the numbers were manipulated, the dollar was worthless, on and on?

I think we forget these things because we now know how the story ends: the stock market went up a lot. If you held on tight, none of those past events mattered. So it’s easy to discount – even ignore – how they felt at the time. You think back and say, “That was so easy, money was free, the market went straight up.” Even if few people actually felt that way during the last 15 years.

So much of what matters in investing – this is true for a lot of things in life – is how you manage the psychology of uncertainty. The problem with looking back with hindsight is that nothing is uncertain. You think no one had anything to worry about, because most of what they were worrying about eventually came to pass.

“You should have been happy and calm, given where things ended up,” you say to your past self. But your past self had no idea where things would end up. Uncertainty dictates nearly everything in the current moment, but looking back we pretend it never existed.

My wife and I recently bought a new house. Like most of the country, it cost – let me put this mildly – a shitload more than it would have a few years ago.

We started talking about how cheap homes were in 2009. In our region they literally cost four to five times more today than  they did then – plus, interest rates were low in 2009, and there was an endless supply of homes on the market to choose from. We said something to the effect of, “People were so lucky back then.”

Then we caught ourselves, shaking off delusion, and thinking, “Wait, do we really have nostalgia for theeconomy of 2009?” That was literally the worst economy in 80 years. All anyone talked about was how terrible everything was. Homes were cheap because unemployment was 10% and the stock market was down 50%.

Looking back, we know 2009 was not only the bottom but the beginning of a new boom (albeit with volatility). But we didn’t know that back then, and it gave us plenty to worry about that’s easy to forget today. What felt like risks then now look like opportunities. What felt like dangers then now look like adventures.

In a similar way, Americans are still nostalgic about life in the 1950s. White picket fences, middle-class prosperity, happy families, a booming economy. There was also the ever-present risk of nuclear annihilation. Today, we know the missile was never launched. But the 5th-grader doing nuclear attack drills by ducking under her school desk? She had no idea, and had plenty to worry about that is impossible to contextualize today, since we know how the story ends. So of course she wasn’t as happy as we think she should have been.

I subscribe to a few Instagram accounts devoted to 1990s nostalgia. I was a kid then, so I’m a sucker for this stuff. The comments on those posts inevitably say some version of, “Those were the best years. The late ‘90s and early 2000s was the best time to be alive.” Maybe it was pretty good. But we also had: A bad recession in 2001, a contested presidential election, 9-11 – which utterly reshaped culture – two wars, a slow economic recovery, on and on. It’s easy to forget all of those because we know the economy recovered, the wars ended, and there wasn’t another major terrorist attack. Everything looks certain in hindsight, but at the time uncertainty ruled the day.

Of course, things could have turned out differently. And for many people – those whowerelaid off, ordidlose their home, ordiddie in war – the happy nostalgia of remembering what life was like before might well be valid.

But as Thomas Jefferson said, “How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened.”

Part of the reason nostalgia exists is because, knowing what we do today, we often look back at the past and say, “you really didn’t have much to worry about.” You adapted and moved on. Isn’t that an important lesson as we look ahead?

Understanding why economic nostalgia is so powerful – why it’s almost impossible to remember how uncertain things were in the past when you know how the story ends – helps explain what I think is the most important lesson in economic history, that’s true for most people most of the time:

The past wasn’t as good as you remember. The present isn’t as bad as you think. The future will be better than you anticipate.

The ultimate success metric is whether you get what you want out of life. But that’s harder than it sounds because it’s easy to try to copy someone who wants something you don’t.

I’ve seen this play out twice: An incredibly talented young writer with a big blog following joins a major media company where they quickly fizzled into irrelevance.

It was the same story each time: When the writer was young and independent they could write with their own voice, their own style, their own flair. They could run with their own intuition.

They were artists, which was what made them great.

Then they joined a big media company, which said, “That’s not how we do things here. Here’s our style book, you must follow it to a T. And meet Gordon, he’s your new editor. He will tell you what to write and when to write it. Good day, sir.”

They became employees, which was their downfall.

And these were very successful media companies. They knew what kind of writing worked and what their readers wanted. But of course it didn’t work out. What was right for the company was wrong for the writer. A talented person can quickly become mediocre when you force them to be someone they aren’t.

Even if you’re not an entrepreneur, there’s so much to learn from that.

It’s so common to on one hand recognize how much variety there is among people – different personalities, backgrounds, goals, skills – but on the other hand ask, “What’s the best way to do this thing?” as if there can be one universal answer for vastly different people.

One area this impacts people is with money, where more damage is caused not by dumb financial plans but by reasonable ones that just aren’t right for you.

How you invest might cause me to lose sleep, and how I invest might prevent you from looking at yourself in the mirror tomorrow. Isn’t that OK? Isn’t it far better to just accept that we’re different rather than arguing over which one of us is right or wrong? And wouldn’t it be dangerous if you became persuaded to invest like me even if it’s wrong for your personality and skill set?

Or take how we spend money. You like this, I like that. Who cares? It gets dangerous when you assume that if someone else is spending their money differently they either must be doing it better than you or doing it wrong. And that’s actually very common, because it’s easy to interpret someone spending money differently than you as an attack on what you’ve chosen to spend money on.

It’s possible to be humble and learn from other people while also recognizing that the best strategy for you is the one closest aligned with your unique personality and skills.

A few things happen when you do.

You do your best work and have the most funwhen you’re not burdened by fear that someone else thinks you’re doing it wrong.

You measure how you’re doing against your personal benchmarks, which can both push you to your potential and prevent you from chasing someone else’s.

You have a much better shot of getting what you want out of life. Which, again, is all that really matters.

President James Garfield died because the best doctors in the country didn’t believe in germs, probing Garfield’s bullet wound after an assassination attempt with ungloved, unwashed fingers that almost certainly contributed to his fatal infection.

It sounds crazy – 1881 wasn’tthatlong ago – but historian Candice Millard writes in her bookDestiny of the Republichow controversial germ theory was to 19th-century doctors:

They found the notion of “invisible germs” to be ridiculous, and they refused to even consider the idea that they could be the cause of so much disease and death.Even the editor of the highly respected Medical Record found more to fear than to admire in [antiseptic pioneer] Lister’s theory. “Judging the future by the past,” he wrote, “we are likely to be as much ridiculed in the next century for our blind belief in the power of unseen germs as our forefathers were for their faith in the influence of spirits.”Not only did many American doctors not believe in germs, they took pride in the particular brand of filth that defined their profession.They spoke fondly of the “good old surgical stink” that pervaded their hospitals and operating rooms, and they resisted making too many concessions even to basic hygiene … They believed that the thicker the layers of dried blood and pus, black and crumbling as they bent over their patients, the greater the tribute to their years of experience … They preferred, moreover, to rely on their own methods of treatment, which not infrequently involved applying a hot poultice of cow manure to an open wound.

Even a child reading this today recognizes how insane this is. And it’s hardly an isolated example. Doctors used toprescribe chloroformfor asthma and cigarettes for hay fever. Theyinjected cow’s milkinto the veins of tuberculosis patients, hoping the fat would transform into white blood cells.

Mercifully, we’ve moved on. We believe new crazy stuff, but notthatcrazy stuff. Everyone learned, those learnings were universally accepted and passed down the generations who are now better off because of it. Reading about medicine from 100 years ago makes you feel utterly disconnected from today’s world, like you’re reading about a different topic altogether.

But take something like money.

These lines were written 130 years ago by author William Dawson:

It would seem that the anxieties of getting money only beget the more torturing anxiety of how to keep it.More lives have been spoiled by competence than by poverty; indeed, I doubt whether poverty has any effect at all upon a strong character, except as a stimulus to exertion.The thing that is least perceived about wealth is that all pleasure in money ends at the point where economy becomes unnecessary. The man who can buy anything he covets values nothing that he buys.

The thing that is least perceived about wealth is that all pleasure in money ends at the point where economy becomes unnecessary. The man who can buy anything he covets values nothing that he buys.

Or this, written by Earnest Hemingway in 1936:

He remembered poor Scott Fitzgerald and his romantic awe of [the rich] … He thought they were a special glamorous race and when he found they weren’t it wrecked him as much as any other thing that wrecked him.

He remembered poor Scott Fitzgerald and his romantic awe of [the rich] … He thought they were a special glamorous race and when he found they weren’t it wrecked him as much as any other thing that wrecked him.

Or this, written by a lawyer in 1934, taking account of the bubble preceding the Great Depression:

In normal times the average professional man makes just a living and lives up to the limit of his income because he must dress well, etc. In times of depression he not only fails to make a living but has no surplus capital to buy bargains in stocks and real estate. I see now how very important it is for the professional man to build up a surplus in normal times. Without it he is at the mercy of the economic winds.

Or this, describing the 1920s Florida real estate:

From 1919 to 1929, both forms of personal debt—mortgages and installment credit—soared. The volume of home mortgages more than tripled, and the amount of outstanding installment debt more than doubled.

Or thisaccountof Seneca, who lived 2,000 years ago:

Enemies accused him of preying on affluent elderly people in the hope of being remembered in their wills, and of “sucking the provinces dry” by lending money at a steep rate of interest to those in the distant parts of the empire.

Enemies accused him of preying on affluent elderly people in the hope of being remembered in their wills, and of “sucking the provinces dry” by lending money at a steep rate of interest to those in the distant parts of the empire.

It’s all so relatable. Like nothing has changed. We’ve always been asking the same questions, dealing with the same problems, and falling for the same false solutions. We probably always will.

Reading old finance articles makes you feel like the ancient past was no different than today – the opposite feeling you get reading old medical commentary.

Of course there are things we knew about medicine 200 years ago that were true and things we believed about money 100 years ago that were false. But in degree there is no comparison – there’s no financial equivalent of everyone denying germs only to eventually agree that it’s so obviously true it’s not worth debating.

In some fields our knowledge is seamlessly passed down across generations. In others, it’s fleeting. To paraphrase investor Jim Grant: Knowledge in some fields is cumulative. In other fields it’s cyclical (at best).

There are occasional periods when society learns that debt can be dangerous, greed backfires, and more money won’t solve all your problems. But it quickly forgets and moves on. Again and again. Generation after generation.

I think there are a few reasons this happens, and what it means we have to accept.

Some fields have quantifiable truths, while others are guided by vague beliefs and individual circumstances. Physicist Richard Feynman said, “Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.” Well, people do. So any topic guided by behavior – money, philosophy, relationships, etc. – can’t be solved with a formula like physics and math.

Neil deGrasse Tyson says, “The good thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it.” You can disagree and say science is the practice of continuous exploration and changing your mind, but in general he’s right. Germ theory is true and we know it’s true. But what about the proper level of savings and spending to live a good life? Or how much risk to take? Or the right investing strategy given today’s economy? Those kinds of questions do not lend themselves to scientific answers. They’re subjective, nuanced, and impacted by how the economy changes over time. So often there simply isn’t relevant information to pass down to the next generations. Even when firm financial rules exist, some truths have to be experienced firsthand to be understood.

Cyclical knowledge, and the inability to fully learn from others’ past experiences, means you have to accept a level of volatility and fragility not found in other fields. I can imagine a world in 50 years where things like cancer and heart disease are either non-existent or effectively controlled. I cannot ever imagine a world where economic volatility is tamed and people stop making financial decisions they eventually regret – no matter how much history of past mistakes we have to study.

ARTICLE 27: A Number From Today and A Story About Tomorrow

Every forecast takes a number from today and multiplies it by a story about tomorrow.

Investment valuations, economic outlooks, political forecasts – they all follow that formula. Something we know multiplied by a story we like.

The trick when forecasting is realizing that’s what you’re doing.

A few weeks before he died a reporter asked Franklin Roosevelt if the Yalta Conference negotiations near the end of World War II set the stage for permanent peace in Europe.

“I can answer that question if you can tell me who your descendants will be in the year 2057,” Roosevelt said. “We can look as far ahead as humanity believes in this sort of thing.”

The deals hammered out in Yalta were the things we knew. How long they’d hold, how much they’d be adhered to, and what else could get in their way is just a story people told and believed in varying degrees.

Anything that tries to forecast what people will do next work like that.

The hard thing is that while the number we know today can be something real and verified, the story we multiply it by is driven by what you want to believe will happen orwhat makes the most sense. Forecasters get into trouble whenthe number we know from todaygives an impression that you’re being objective and data-driven whenthe story about tomorrowis so subject to opinion.

When valuing a company, revenue/cash flow/profits is the number we know. The earnings multiple you attach to that figure is just a story about future growth.

Same with economic trends. We have lots of data, but none of it means much until you attach a story to it about what you think it means and what you think people will do with it next.

That seems obvious to me. But ask forecasters if they think the majority of what they do is storytelling and you’ll get blank stares. At best. It never seems like storytelling when you’re basing a forecast in data.

And while data-driven storytelling doesn’t mean guessing, it doesn’t mean prophecy.

We can use historical data to assume a trend will continue, but that’s just a story we want to believe in a world wherethings changeall the time.

We can use data to assume a crazy event will revert to the norm, but that’s also just a story in a world where unsustainabletrends last longerthan people think.

Few things escape that reality. B.H. Liddell Hart writes in the bookWhy Don’t We Learn From History?:

[History] cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is selection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for what proves them right and confirms their personal opinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to be on the side of the angels.

In finance this point is made with the quip that more fiction has been written in Excel than in Word.

None of this is bad. I think it’s just realistic, and it means all of us should keep a few things in mind.

1. A fact multiplied by a story always equals something less than a fact.So almost all predictions have less than a 100% chance of coming true. That’s not a bold statement, but if you embrace it it always pushes you towards room for error and the ability to endure surprise.

2. The most persuasive stories are what you want to believe are true or are an extension of what you’ve experienced firsthand, which is what makes forecasting so hard.

3. If you’re trying to figure out where something is going next, you have to understand more than its technical possibilities. You have to understand the stories everyone tells themselves about those possibilities, because it’s such a big part of the forecasting equation.

4. When interest rates are low, the story side of the equation becomes more powerful. When short-term results aren’t competing for attention with interest rates, most of a company’s valuation comes from what it might be able to achieve in the future. That, of course, is just a story. And people can come up with some wild stories.

I once asked a successful author how to market a book. He waved me off and said, “If the book is good you don’t need to market it. If the book is bad, no amount of marketing will help.”

He was exaggerating: I think his advice is like 80% true. But it’sdefinitely80% true. And it applies to almost any product. The best marketing is a good product.

Charlie Munger once talked about how sensational Costco founder Jim Sinegal’s career was.

Podcaster David Senra asked Munger: Why are there so few speeches or interviews with Sinegal?

“He was busy working,” said Munger.

The most impressive people don’t spend their lives on social media or managing their publicity.

Economist Russ Roberts couldn’t figure out why so many World War II veterans hated the Red Cross.

The Red Cross? How can you hate them? But he kept hearing it over and over again.

Asked where the animosity came from, the vets kept talking about the donuts. The donuts, the donuts, the donuts.

During World War II the Red Cross set up comfort stations across Europe for Allied soldiers to get a haircut, coffee, and donuts. It was free for the Americans, but British and Canadian soldiers were charged a few cents. That created a hierarchy that hurt morale, so American generals eventually asked the Red Cross to start charging the American soldiers too.

Suddenly U.S. troops – accustomed to getting free donuts – were being charged. And they hated it, viewing the Red Cross as a greedy profiteer exploiting their hunger. The grudge remained for decades after the war.

Two lessons here: It’s almost impossible to charge for something once you’ve given it away for free, so choose your business model carefully. And people are extremely sensitive to even reasonable price changes, which is why inflation is always an emotional issue.

Jerry Seinfeldrecently said:

Audiences are now flocking to stand-up because it’s something you can’t fake. It’s like platform diving. You could say you’re a platform diver, but in two seconds we can see if you are or you aren’t. That’s what people like about stand-up. They can trust it. Everything else is fake.

His advice: “Get good at something. That’s it. Everything else is bullshit.”

Demographic historian T.H. Hollingsworth once published an analysis of the life expectancy of the British peerage. It showed a peculiar trend: Before the 1700s, the richest members of society had among the shortest lives – meaningfully below that of the overall population.

How could that be?

The best explanation is that the rich were the only ones who could afford all the quack medicines and sham doctors who peddled hope but increased your odds of being poisoned.

I would bet good money the same happens today with investing advice.

If a petty criticism about you is obviously false, you tend not to care. If anything it just makes the person criticizing you look dumb.

If the criticism could be true, you might become outraged because you know it’s a genuine attack on your identity.

Talking to Tim Ferriss, Naval Ravikant oncesaid:

If I said, “Tim Ferriss is fat,” that would just bounce right off of you. But if I said, “Tim Ferriss and Naval are fake gurus,” that might hit us, right?

I thought about this when I heard an FBI interrogator say the #1 way to spot someone covering up a lie is how angry and righteous they become when defending themselves.

After the November, 1930 election, Republicans and Democrats held an even number of seats in the House of Representatives. A perfect tie.

By the time members were sworn in, thirteen had died, most of them Republicans. Special elections to replace them fell in Democrats’ favor, and when the Congress first met the Democrats held a comfortable majority.

Remember this the next time you hear a confident political forecast. No one knows anything, even when it looks obvious.

A similar story, from investor Howard Marks:

I tell my father’s story of the gambler who one day hears about a race with only one horse in it, so he bet the rent money. Halfway around the track the horse jumped over the fence and ran away.

A coach once described the rule of thirds for athletes: When training, one-third of your days should feel good, one-third should feel OK, and one-third should feel terrible. That’s a good, balanced, routine. It’s when you know you’re pushing yourself, but not too hard. Taking risks, but not overdoing it. Have challenging goals, but not unrealistic ones.

I think you can apply that to businesses, careers, and relationships: If it’s always terrible, you’re doing it wrong. If it always feels great, you’re naive, oblivious, or undershooting your potential.

Yale economist Robert Shiller won the Nobel Prize in economics in part for his work developing a nationwide index of U.S. housing prices dating back to the 1800s.

I once asked him: where did he find home price data from the 1800s?

“The library,” he said, dryly.

“It’s in a book by Grabler, Blank and Winnick, a National Bureau of Research volume in the early 1950s. They had a nice analysis; wonderful book. I could recommend you read it, but nobody reads it, nobody reads it.”

There’s a well-known idea in real estate that you earn the highest ROI on the ugliest properties no one wants to own. The same is true for so many things in life: The unsexy work, where there’s little competition, is where some of the biggest ideas are found.

A startup founder I know was once trying to raise money from an investor. The investor told him, “I love your idea, but I think this only has a 20% chance of working.”

The founder replied: “Twenty percent? Wow, you’re an optimist. I think the odds are 10%, max.”

This was from a founder who was devoting his life to this company, with full passion and energy.

Jeff Bezos oncesaid:

Every startup company is unlikely to work. It’s helpful to be in reality about that, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be optimistic. So you have to have this duality in your head. On the one hand, you know what the baseline statistics say about startup companies, and the other hand, you have to ignore all of that and just be 100% sure it’s going to work, and you’re doing both things at the same time. You’re holding that contradiction in your head.

Before playing the Cleveland Cavaliers, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich was asked by the press how his team could stop the Cav’s impressive run. “How do you feel your defense can get into passing lanes and stop it?” they asked.

“Oh, we probably won’t. I can give you some bullshit if you want,” Popovich said.

We need more of this. There’s a fine line between motivational cheerleading and lying.

Ronald Reagan once told this story.

There were two brothers. One was a dyed-in-the-wool pessimist. The other an incurable optimist.

The parents thought both kids were so unrealistic that they talked to a psychiatrist, who came up with an idea for Christmas: Give the pessimistic boy a roomful of the most incredible toys and tell them they’re all for him. Give the optimistic boy a roomful of horse manure and tell him that’s all he’s getting. That should cure them.

The parents did it. When they checked on their boys, the pessimist with all the toys was crying. “Someone is going to take all of these away from me,” he said.

The optimistic kid with a roomful of horseshit had never been happier. He was digging frantically. “There’s got to be a pony in here somewhere,” he said.

Optimists and pessimists don’t respond to the information they see as much as they do an interpretation of what they want to see.

Mr. Beast – the most successful YouTube creator – said it’s easier to make one video that gets 10 million views than it is to make 100 videos that get 100,000 views. Why? Because the best content is evergreen. It will be as relevant 10 years from now as it is today – and still getting views – which is so much more powerful than trying to get people’s attention with an idea that might be relevant today but no one will care about next Tuesday.

In his 1818 poemOzymandias, Percy Bysshe Shelley writes about coming across the rubble of a destroyed, millennia-old monument in the middle of nowhere. Nothing about the monument can be identified, except the base, with an inscription that reads:

“My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; / Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”

“My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; / Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”

No one will remember you in 100 years, and it’s helpful to remember that when making big life decisions.
