Threads
The dream of the Fediverse is alive on Threads
Decentralized media is off to an agonizingly slow start — but there are glimmers of progress

The Fediverse feed in Threads. (Meta)
A couple of weeks from now, it will have been two years since
Meta introduced Threads
. From the start, everything about the app seemed unlikely, starting with the fact that Meta was introducing a bare-bones Twitter clone in the year 2023.
But nothing about the app was more unusual than the fact that Meta said it would make Threads part of the Fediverse: that collection of social products connected with open protocols. After decades of building extremely lucrative walled gardens like Facebook and Instagram, Meta said it would make Threads interoperable with other products built on the ActivityPub protocol.
To the surprise of some, the company actually followed through. It built features to let Threads users
share their posts to the Fediverse
, meaning that someone who preferred Mastodon could follow a user on Threads and see that user's posts in their Mastodon feed. They also enabled
Fediverse replies to Threads posts
for those who opt in, and let
Threads users follow Fediverse accounts
.
Despite Threads' efforts, the Fediverse remains far from a mainstream phenomenon. Threads, which has
350 million monthly users
, is the largest app in the network by far. Mastodon, which created the underlying protocol and was previously the biggest app in the network,
has fewer than 800,000 monthly users
. The
rest of the Fediverse
, which includes YouTube clone PeerTube and photo-sharing service Pixelfed, adds only around 300,000 total unique users.
Meanwhile Bluesky, a decentralized app built on the rival AT Protocol, registered an impressive
36 million users
— but
fewer than 4 million
of those were active in the past week.
Slate
's Luke Winkie wrote last week that the app has been in a "
frustrating downward spiral
" owing to its monolithic leftist politics and culture of aggressive scolding in the replies.
Meanwhile, X has retained hundreds of millions of users that it accumulated while it was still Twitter. Key audiences — particularly people interested in artificial intelligence and sports fans — have refused to move, no matter what indignities Elon Musk subjects them to.
They are undoubtedly there in large part because they believe that if they post it on X, people will see it. If they posted it elsewhere, people may not.
That classic chicken-and-egg problem of social media is just one of the reasons the Fediverse has grown slowly over the past couple years. But it is possible to solve it — and on Tuesday, Threads offered one potential answer: a dedicated feed of Fediverse posts.
Here's
David Pierce at
The Verge
:
Starting today, if you’ve
turned on fediverse sharing
in Threads, there will be a new section at the top of your Following feed that takes you to a list of posts from folks you follow on Mastodon,
Flipboard
, or wherever else you’ve connected your Threads account. It’s very much a separate feed, which Meta software engineer Peter Cottle tells me is deliberate. “For everything from integrity to user impersonation, just for user understanding, it’s nice to have it as kind of a separate thing.” The Fediverse feed isn’t algorithmically ranked, or subject to any of Threads’ rules or moderation; it’s just a reverse-chronological feed of stuff you follow.
Over time, Cottle says, Meta could mix the posts more, but he’s not sure that’s the right idea. “There’s actually kind of a different use case for fediverse consumption,” he says, that’s more like old-school RSS readers. “I might want to subscribe to Ghost publications, or subscribe to different authors, so I have this dedicated place to catch up on my across-the-web content, separately from a Following feed or a For You feed.” Even internally at Meta, he says, there’s some debate about whether Threads wants to be a fully open social network or should just act as a repository for all that external content.
In a
separate Q&A
, Cottle noted that Threads now interacts with 75 percent of servers on the Fediverse — "sending posts, likes, and replies back and forth over the Internet in a decentralized way."
I can understand anyone who greets this news with a hearty "who cares?" For the moment, there simply isn't all that much to browse on the Fediverse. Few people get excited about having one more feed to browse.
At the same time, the Fediverse has lacked a lot of the basic infrastructure necessary for apps like Threads to surface interesting posts and accounts. The addition of a Fediverse feed is a meaningful step to address that: giving people a place they can follow and interact with individual publications (including, soon,
Platformer
) in the same way they do with Threads accounts. That's the sort of thing the Fediverse was always meant to make possible, and it's just now coming into view.
The death of Twitter offered a powerful reason why we might not want to have powerful networks in the hands of a single person or company. The promise of the Fediverse is not unlike the promise of the web itself — that a rich network of individuals, interacting over open protocols, can build something together that is greater than any one app or site.
Visibility on Threads offers people one reason they may want to build in the Fediverse, as opposed to somewhere else. If enough of them do, it could begin to accelerate demand for other apps and services.
All of this remains a longshot. But I don't know anyone who is satisfied with the status quo. Threads keeps building tiny bridges to the open web; now we'll see who out there may be willing to cross them.

OpenAI and Microsoft are fighting
Everyone is talking about a pair of stories that highlight OpenAI’s frustrations with Microsoft as it seeks to come to an agreement that will allow it to
simplify its byzantine corporate structure
.
For six years, the agreement between the companies has been straightforward. Microsoft gives OpenAI funding and infrastructure to train and serve AI models; in exchange, Microsoft gets access to all of OpenAI’s intellectual property, and can use it to develop its own AI products.
Tensions between the companies first emerged when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was briefly fired in 2023, threatening to send the company’s value — and Microsoft’s then-$13 billion investment — to zero. Since then, Microsoft has complained that OpenAI is slow to share its cutting-edge technology with it. And OpenAI has complained that Microsoft is too stingy with computing resources.
In the
Wall Street Journal
yesterday, Berber Jin
reported on a new flashpoint
: OpenAI’s intended acquisition of coding startup Windsurf. OpenAI doesn’t want Microsoft to get access to Windsurf’s intellectual property, which could help it build its GitHub Copilot assistant and blunt any advantage that that same IP could give to ChatGPT. It’s so frustrated with Microsoft that it has considered accusing the company publicly of anticompetitive behavior, Jin reported.
The Information
today corroborated that report, noting that
negotiations over the for-profit conversion have gone on for eight months and do not appear to be close to resolution
. Sri Muppidi and Aaron Holmes report that Microsoft is seeking a 33 percent stake in the for-profit entity in exchange for giving up rights to OpenAI’s future profits. OpenAI wants the right to sell its models on cloud platforms other than Microsoft’s Azure — and to exempt the Windsurf acquisition from the IP sharing requirements of the original contract.
So far, all of this thrashing hasn’t amounted to much: Microsoft and OpenAI continue to ship new products at a rapid clip. But if you believe that the AI race is entering some sort of endgame in the next few years, as many OpenAI employees do, it’s worth asking at what point the overhang of all this conflict risks making both companies less competitive than they otherwise might be.

The influencer presidency
Yesterday I wrote about
the darkly comic spectacle of the Trump Organization’s T1 phone
. Today
The Verge
’s Alison Johnson investigates
which Chinese-designed smartphone it will likely be based on
. Will it be the DOOGEE Note 58? The Ulefone Note 18 Ultra? Or perhaps the Revvl 7? I can’t wait to find out.
xAI is burning cash
When last we left Elon Musk’s xAI, its also-ran chatbot Grok
had become briefly obsessed with white genocide
. I wrote about it then as an example of tech companies using AI to advance political causes. It was also an example of how developers attempting to change one particular characteristic of their large language model can also just make the whole thing worse. (Here’s
a fun paper on that phenomenon
.)
Making the world’s eighth-best chatbot isn’t just technically difficult — it’s hugely expensive, too. Bloomberg reports that the company has recently been trying to
borrow $5 billion in debt while also raising another $4.3 billion in new equity
. That’s on top of the $14 billion it has already raised; of that, the company has already spent $10 billion, according to Carmen Arroyo and Jill R Shah.
The company is spending the money as fast as it’s raising it, burning about $1 billion a month, the same journalists report in
a separate story today
. Of course, none of the big labs are yet earning profits. But OpenAI, for example, expects to generate $12.7 billion in revenue this year; xAI projects just $500 million.
Musk, who is worth more than $400
billion
, can afford to bankroll xAI’s misadventures for some time. But Meta has
learned the hard way
that throwing money at LLMs is no guarantee of building a competitive model. And xAI’s leader seems
far more invested in removing “wokeness” from Grok
than he does making it useful.

Meta looks for an AI reset
Mark Zuckerberg knows the company needs a new AI strategy. Is Scale's Alexandr Wang the partner he needs?

This is a column about AI. My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See
my full ethics disclosure here
.
Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that Meta is considering
a large investment in data infrastructure provider Scale AI
. Today, fresh reports in
Bloomberg
and the
New York Times
revealed what Meta is getting for its roughly $14 billion. In addition to acquiring 49 percent of Scale, 28-year-old Scale founder Alexandr Wang will join Meta as an executive, leading a new team of extremely expensive researchers in an effort to build superhuman AI.
The deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday.
Meta and Scale declined to comment. But I spent the past day talking to people close to the deal, and can independently confirm many of the details in those Bloomberg and
Times
reports. Today, let's talk about what Meta is up to, and explore whether this is the AI reset that the company has been looking for since
the disappointment of Llama 4
.
I.
First, the details. Founded in 2016, Scale's primary business is in labeling data for use in the training of AI systems. For example, it might hire subcontractors to identify and categorize content that violates Meta's community standards to help train machine-learning classifiers. Scale, like Meta,
has been sued by former content moderators over its labor practices
.
Meta is one of its largest customers, but it also provides services to Meta's rivals, including Google DeepMind and OpenAI. One person I spoke with said Scale expects those companies will stop using Scale's services, for fear of Meta using information about their usage to gain a competitive advantage. As part of the deal, Meta has agreed to dramatically increase its spending with Scale.

This column touches on AI. My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See
my full ethics disclosure here
.
It has now been a year since
Apple executives stood on stage
and heralded a revolution to their platform that would be powered by artificial intelligence. Or, as the company sought to brand it,
Apple
Intelligence — a version of AI that was both highly personalized to you and your devices,
and
more protective of your privacy than its rivals. Apple Intelligence would take advantage of the company's deep knowledge about its users, scouring their emails, texts, and contacts to route requests around the operating system and take actions on your behalf.
It was an appealing vision. But it
never shipped
. In March, amid mounting questions over when a bunch of features due to ship in 2024 might actually arrive, Apple finally squeaked out
an update
: they would now arrive "in the coming year," much later than planned, and long after Apple had aired television ads promoting them.
It was more bad news for Apple in a year that has seen plenty of it, from
a failed tug-of-war with President Trump
over tariffs to
being excoriated by a federal judge
over its malicious compliance in an antitrust case, who referred the company to prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation.
All of which set the stage today for an unusually high-stakes Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple remains one of the world's biggest companies, of course, and its products largely continue to be beloved. But for the first time in a long time, there is a sense that Apple has begun to lose the plot —
too slow
to recognize the potential of AI, and not capable enough to realize it.
In some ways, Monday's keynote presentation seemed to confirm some of those suspicions. Many of the announcements were almost comically modest: a new naming scheme for the company's operating systems! A Phone app for the desktop! Windows on the iPad that you can resize!
There was also, front and center, a streak of defiance. After CEO Tim Cook welcomed people to WWDC by promoting an upcoming Apple movie about race cars, software engineering chief Craig Federighi began his remarks with the AI features that Apple
did
ship last year: writing tools, a ChatGPT integration, and 15 other things that I mostly had to look up to remember what they did. (Do
you
know what the
Image Wand
is?)
There were also promises of new AI features to come. One update will let you
ask ChatGPT about anything you're seeing on your screen
. Another will
give third-party developers access
to on-device large language models. And its Xcode development tool will get code completion assistance from OpenAI, though developers can also bring in their own models using API keys.
That's all fine, though given what we're seeing elsewhere —
LLMs working unsupervised for seven hours to refactor code bases
, for example — it hardly seems like the state of the art. More disappointingly, I think, the many Apple announcements on Monday failed to cohere around any particular vision for its technology aside from "use it more."
At other times, Apple has sought to inspire with visions of how technology can uniquely advance human progress. But the Apple of "Think Different" and computers as bicycles for the mind was hard to see on Monday. Instead, we saw a long procession of knowledge workers engaged in the tedious meta-work of modern life: rearranging windows on an iPad; polling the group chat about times to meet; setting up a virtual clock.
Contrast that with Google, which used
its developer conference this year
to show an agent that browses the web on your behalf, an AI filmmaking tool already being used in production, and Gmail writing in your voice. Some of those features are currently vaporware. But there's a clear vision there.
Of course, Apple has its own little productivity boosts to offer. My favorite thing Apple showed off on Monday was an update to Spotlight — the built-in launcher on macOS. While it was initially a novel way to search for files on your Mac, Spotlight has long been replaced on my computers with more full-featured launchers like Alfred and
Raycast
.
The next version of Spotlight will take a step in Raycast's direction — evolving from a simple launcher to a kind of command center for your computer. In addition to file search, you'll be able to take actions, such as sending messages. You'll also be able to run shortcuts. There's nothing there that would cause me to uninstall Raycast, but this is the kind of stuff I like to see Apple do: make serious but easy-to-use features for people who want to get stuff done a little more efficiently.
On the other end of the spectrum, for me anyway, was "Liquid Glass" — a redesign of Apple's operating systems designed to make everything translucent and
borderline unreadable
. I haven't seen the design up close and know that reflexive dislike of redesigns is so common as to be cliché. And yet I'm struck by, despite all the minutes spent on stage discussing Liquid Glass, how little of that time was spent explaining what it was meant to
do
.
We heard endlessly about how pretty it is, how it reflects the light, and how it shifts effortlessly into dark mode. But we heard almost nothing about what the design is meant to do.
At the risk of lapsing into another cliché — quoting Steve Jobs — that seems like an oversight. In 2003, Jobs had this to say to the
New York Times
,
about the design of the iPod
: ''Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. 'People think it's this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.''
Liquid glass looks like the product of a design process led by someone saying "Make it look good." I'm sure it "works" fine. But I'm not sure what it is meant to do that its predecessor did not.
How much does any of this matter? Even on this uncertain footing, Apple remains a monolith. Most people rarely switch device ecosystems, and even Google has yet to figure out an AI feature powerful enough to spur large groups of iPhone owners to trade them in for Pixels.
Apple still has plenty of new widgets it can show off. But the vision behind all that activity feels a little muddy — and the company's rivals, including Google and OpenAI, seem to have a much stronger idea of what they are doing. Apple can still do great things — but for now, it seems fixated on the low-hanging fruit.

The Musk-Trump blow-up
Elon Musk relaxed his campaign against President Trump over the weekend, turning the attention of his X feed to an interest he still shares with the administration: whipping up anti-immigrant sentiment. On Sunday he reposted one of Trump's Truth Social posts, seeming to signal some sort of intention to make up.
Trump, for his part, has played down the significance of Musk’s departure. But on Saturday he
told NBC News
that “there would be ‘serious consequences’ if tech mogul Elon Musk funds Democratic candidates to run against Republicans who vote in favor of the GOP’s sweeping budget bill.” And the administration is concerned about
the security implications
of installing Musk’s Starlink at the White House.

Elon Musk
The bro-ligarchy blows up
Musk has gone to war with Donald Trump. What happens next?

Here's this week's free edition of
Platformer
: a look at the all-too-predictable end to Elon Musk's unprecedented partnership with Donald Trump, and what happens next.

It did not take any particular skill in forecasting to predict, at the end of 2024, that the unprecedented partnership between Donald Trump and Elon Musk would come to a dramatic ending. Both Trump and Musk are independently famous for their erratic leadership styles and abrupt purges of once-close allies, and neither shows any long-term patience for anyone who opposes them.
Still, when I predicted here in December that
the bro-ligarchy would collapse
in 2025, I can’t say I had envisioned what transpired over the past few days.
As Musk’s time as a special federal government employee wound down last month, it seemed as if the partnership between Trump and Musk would be preserved. As recently as May 30, Trump said that Musk is
"really not leaving" and was "going to be back and forth."
But just five days later, Musk snapped. On Wednesday, he called Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” — a massive spending package that is now working its way through Congress — “a disgusting abomination.” In a series of X posts, Musk complained that the bill was “pork-filled,” and suggested that it would raise the national debt to unsustainable levels.
Musk is just as likely to have been angry about the pork that
wasn’t
in the bill — namely, an electric vehicle tax credit that significantly benefits Tesla; and a deal for the Federal Aviation Administration to use Musk’s Starlink satellite network for air traffic control, which he had sought to no avail.
Axios
’ Mark Caputo reported that Musk was also angry that Trump withdrew the nomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacman
to lead NASA
. (Musk has also suggested he
had no issue
with the cancellation of the EV tax credit.)
All of that set the stage for a particularly 2025 phenomenon: two extraordinarily powerful billionaires lambasting one another from the social networks that they own.
“Time to drop the really big bomb,” Musk
posted to X
on Thursday afternoon. Trump “is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”
Musk was apparently referring to files pertaining to an investigation of the financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in a federal jail in 2019. It has long been established that Trump knew Epstein socially. In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi
released
a set of files related to the investigation that it turned out had mostly already been made public. Right-wing influencers, who are obsessed with Epstein and the possibility that other elites are linked to the sex-trafficking allegations against him, were
hugely disappointed
.
The FBI has been preparing to release additional files, the
New York Times
reported today
. With his post, Musk suggested without evidence that Trump is behind the hold-up. As the
Times
notes, simply being mentioned in the many thousands of pages of files doesn’t necessarily mean anything substantive. But it could nonetheless be used as fuel for conspiracy theories and world-building.
Trump, for his part, seemed to shrug off Musk’s allegations in a series of posts on Truth Social. (The social network, being accustomed to receiving significant traffic, briefly went down on Thursday afternoon.)
He wrote
:  “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!”
Trump then suggested he would seek to cancel Musk’s contracts with the government.
“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,”
he wrote
. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”
In the immediate aftermath of this blow-up, it’s tempting to focus only on what both men stand to lose. (And we’ll get there.) But I think it’s just as important to remember what Trump and Musk got from this partnership. Trump got an
unprecedented $290 million
in donations from Musk, along with constant promotion of his candidacy on X (and constant criticism of opponent Kamala Harris.) And once he was elected, Musk served as a kind of heat shield for Trump in Washington, absorbing huge amounts of criticism that might otherwise have been leveled solely at the president as he and DOGE decimated federal agencies.
Meanwhile, when Musk joined the Trump administration, 11 federal agencies had “more than 32 continuing investigations, pending complaints or enforcement actions into Mr. Musk’s six companies,”
according to the
Times
. The Musk-led assault on the federal bureaucracy dramatically weakened those agencies, throwing the future of many of those investigations into doubt. Meanwhile, Musk
set up Starlink in the White House
at the same time Trump ambassadors
pushed Starlink in Africa
. He used his proximity to Trump to
boost the valuation of X, which he absorbed into xAI
at an inflated valuation, and
introduced Grok AI to the federal government
. He attempted to block an OpenAI deal with the United Arab Emirates
unless that same deal would benefit xAI
.
A report by Senate Democrats found that Musk’s cost-cutting measures
protected him from up to $2.37 billion in legal liability from US agencies
.
This is why I could never take seriously reports that Musk planned to step back from politics and become “
super focused
” on his companies. He was super focused on his companies the whole time.
In any case, Musk has now
called for Trump’s impeachment
, said that Trump’s
tariffs will cause a recession
, and posted a poll wondering if he should
start a new political party
. After Trump suggested he might cut Musk’s federal contracts, Musk
said
SpaceX would “begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.” Dragon is currently the only means to take US astronauts to and from the International Space Station.
It seems certain all of this will continue to evolve at a rapid clip over the next several days. As dramatic as today’s outbursts seem, it also does not seem out of the question that Trump and Musk will eventually mend fences.
But that’s not going to happen today — and maybe not for a long time. With that in mind, let’s look at some potential consequences for key players.
What does it mean for Musk
?
In the short term: more trouble for those businesses he’s super focused on. Tesla stock
declined 14 percent
on Thursday, erasing $150 billion in market value. Just as worryingly, from Musk’s perspective, may be that all those federal investigations that he seemed to have effectively sidelined may resume with new vigor. One of Musk’s lobbying priorities has been to pave the way for Teslas
to be used as self-driving “robotaxis,”
even though they
lack LIDAR sensors
and other safety features found on Waymos and other autonomous vehicles. He’s going to have a harder time getting that one through Congress now.
Things could get much worse. Steve Bannon, a former top aide to the president who has long detested the Tesla CEO, told the
Times
that
he is advising Trump to deport Musk
. He also said the federal government should investigate recent reports of
Musk’s drug use
.
I
wrote in October
that billionaires should resist cozying up to authoritarians: while it can feel as if they are reducing risks to themselves and their businesses, surrendering to a corrupt system is just as likely to endanger them. Musk is the first to learn this lesson, but I suspect he will not be the last.
What does it mean for Trump
?
As president of the United States, Trump has less to lose. He’s already won the election, and has much less need for Musk’s money. (Though Musk
did promise
to make a $100 million payment to his political action committee in March; Trump will now need to find that money elsewhere. Time to launch a new memecoin!)
To the extent that Musk absorbed some criticism that might otherwise have been directed at Trump, the president will now have to bear the brunt of that himself. He may also need a new way to get astronauts into space, should Musk follow through with his threats about SpaceX and Dragon.
It’s possible Musk’s allies will side with the CEO over the president, reducing Trump’s support in Silicon Valley. But I suspect most of them will remain fairly quiet: JD Vance is their guy, not Trump. If they can grin and bear it until the end of Trump’s term, they will.
One question that I suspect is being debated in the White House right now: what to do about DOGE? That operation was staffed by Musk’s people; the loyalty-obsessed Trump may now view them as an insider threat. Their sudden exit could introduce yet more chaos into the federal bureaucracy.
What does it mean for AI?
Had they stayed close, I envisioned a world in which someday Trump might entrust Musk with oversight of powerful AI systems. It was so easy to imagine Musk convincing the president that AI had suddenly become too dangerous, and needed to be nationalized under his control.
That possibility appears to have just vaporized. Meanwhile, OpenAI has managed to develop
a seemingly chummy relationship with the president
. For that reason, I’d say Thursday is the best day Sam Altman has had in quite some time.

The chatbots are hallucinating
Amanda Guinzburg writes on her Substack about a common frustration with chatbots:
they keep making things up
. This feels like it should be easy to solve at the product level: stop the bot from telling people it has read links sent to them when the bot has not.
Not all bots are equal when it comes to hallucinations, though.

The AI browser wars are about to begin
Artificial intelligence is already writing an obituary for the internet as we know it. So why is everyone building new web browsers?

Here's this week's free edition of
Platformer
: a look at a surprising sign of the web's resilience amid an onslaught of AI slop: a surprising number of companies are building new browsers. But it may not be good news for the internet as we know it.

The state of web publishing looks increasingly grim. Dotdash Meredith, which publishes sites including
People
and
Food & Wine,
said on its most recent earnings call
that traffic from Google is now roughly half what it was four years ago.
Business Insider
said on Thursday
that it was laying off 21 percent of its staff, saying the business “must be structured to endure extreme traffic drops outside of our control.” It joined a list of publishers that have laid off journalists this year that also includes
CNN
,
Vox Media
,
HuffPost
, and
NBC
.
The web is much larger than the collection of sites that publish journalism, of course. But
nearly two-thirds of adults
say that one of their main reasons for using the internet is to get information. And each year there are fewer journalists being paid to put that information online.
It's enough that you could write a plausible obituary for the web — and
I've tried
. Publishers have fewer and fewer viable avenues to distribute their work, and their advertising-based businesses struggle to compete with those of the tech giants'. Meanwhile, vast swaths of their archives were hoovered up by AI companies to serve as the (uncompensated) basis for the chatbots that now serve as increasingly good substitutes for them. Google now serves its AI Overviews to
more than 1.5 billion people
— people who previously might have clicked a link.
Recently, though, the decline of the web has been met with a surprising counter-phenomenon: a huge investment in new web
browsers
.
On Wednesday, Opera — the Norwegian company whose namesake browser commands about 2 percent market share worldwide —
announced that it is building a new browser
.
Two days earlier, the Browser Company said it plans to open source its Arc browser and turn its efforts fully
to a new one
.
The moves came a few months after "answer engine" company Perplexity teased
a new browser of its own called Comet
. And while the company has not confirmed it, OpenAI has reportedly been
working on a browser for more than six months
.
It has been a long time since the internet saw a proper browser war. The first, in the earliest days of the web, saw Microsoft's Internet Explorer defeat Netscape Navigator decisively. (Though not before a bruising antitrust trial.) In the second, which ran from roughly
2004 to 2017
, new browsers from Mozilla (Firefox) and Google (Chrome) emerged to challenge Internet Explorer and eventually kill it. Today the majority of web users
use Chrome
.
But two forces are coming together to inspire a potential third browser war. The first is that Chrome is under direct assault from the US government, which is currently trying to
force Google to divest it
as a remedy to the company's search monopoly. (
OpenAI
and
Perplexity
have both offered, helpfully, to take it off Google's hands.) Whether or not that effort is successful, it is a hugely distracting battle that can open up room for competition.
The second force, of course, is AI. And just as the rise of ChatGPT highlighted users' dissatisfaction with web search as it existed before 2022, these new browsers may reveal that Chrome no longer effectively serves them, either.
Search and browsers are two sides of the same coin. When you search for something on the web, you see your results in a browser. That's what made Chrome such a great investment for Google. Its innovative
omnibox
address bar, which would go on to become the industry standard, encouraged you to search more than ever. And as Chrome gained market share, Google leveraged its influence to make the world increasingly Google-shaped: easy to index, to search, and to serve ads against.
Today, a new generation of companies are coming to the same conclusion that Google did a generation ago: if you're really serious about search, you should build a browser.
"Traditional browsers were built to load webpages," said Josh Miller, the Browser Company's CEO, in
a post
announcing its forthcoming Dia browser. "But increasingly, webpages — apps, articles, and files — will become tool calls with AI chat interfaces. In many ways, chat interfaces are already acting like browsers: they search, read, generate, respond. They interact with APIs, LLMs, databases. And people are spending hours a day in them. If you’re skeptical, call a cousin in high school or college — natural language interfaces, which abstract away the tedium of old computing paradigms, are here to stay."
Opera is making a similar pitch its forthcoming browser Neon. (It launched a different browser under the same name
in 2017
.) Here's
Jess Weatherbed at
The Verge
:
“We’re at a point where AI can fundamentally change the way we use the internet and perform all sorts of tasks in the browser,” Opera senior AI product director Henrik Lexow said in the company’s press release. “Opera Neon brings this to our users’ fingertips.”
A notable early adopter feature is an AI engine that Opera says is “capable of understanding and interpreting” what users request, and then making it with the help of cloud-based AI agents. For example, Opera says that Neon can make games, reports, code snippets, and websites, and can work on multiple tasks even when the user has gone offline.
Here, I think we begin to understand the opportunity that companies see here — and why "web browser" probably isn't the best word for what they are building. Or, if it is, we should at least note that in this vision it is not a
person
who is browsing the web. It is an AI agent.
That this would be the near-term goal of every search-adjacent company has been clear since at least last year, when Google announced
its intention to do the Googling for you
.
What was not then clear, at least to me, is that so many companies would seek to challenge Google not just in search but in the software that generates those searches.
Will it work? Getting people to switch browsers is very difficult. Previous platform shifts that some entrepreneurs believed would create new opportunities turned out to be mirages. (Remember
Rockmelt and the era of the "social browser"
?) And surely Google will attempt to match any new entrant feature for feature in Chrome, just as it has with ChatGPT and search.
Still, it's easy to imagine the possibilities for an AI browser. It could function as a research assistant, exploring topics on your behalf and keeping tabs on new developments automatically. It could take your to-do list and attempt to complete tasks for you while you're away. It could serve as a companion for you while you browse, identifying factual errors and suggesting further reading.
In the first wave of AI disruption, challengers attempted to replace search engines with "answer engines." The browser war to come, I think, will look similarly: seeking to replace browsing with actions taken on your behalf.
The question remains, though, what will be left to browse. The entire structure of the web — from journalism to e-commerce and beyond — is built on the idea that webpages are being viewed by people. When it's mostly code that is doing the looking, a lot of basic assumptions are going to get broken.
To the browser warriors suiting up for battle, that looks like an exciting opportunity. To everyone else, though, it still feels mostly like a problem.

This is a column about AI. My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See
my full ethics disclosure here
.
MOUNTAIN VIEW — Last year, it was "
let Google do the Googling for you
."
This year, you can do the danged Googling yourself.
At Google I/O on Tuesday, the company made a noticeable shift in the way it talks about artificial intelligence. Last year, the company wanted us to sit back and watch its primitive agents read the web on our behalf. This year, the company asks us to sit up straight,
pay it $250
, and get to work.
At I/O this year, the AI works best when you work, too. A sizzle reel that airs early during the
two-hour keynote
encourages us to run physics simulations, turn images into code, build robots, and write code via voice instructions.
Thirty ideas for how to work with AI flash on the screen, and when that's done, the AI offers 30 more.
"We are in a new phase of the AI platform shift," CEO Sundar Pichai tells us, "where decades of research are becoming reality for people all over the world."
At I/O, Pichai and a procession of executives offer their version of this reality. It's a world where AI is a coworker and a superpower. Where endless drudgery is automated away, without ever seeming to threaten anyone's job. Where the AI search results are so good that people use Google more than ever, and rely on the web more than ever.
It's a reality where software engineers see many of the benefits first. Google I/O is the rare Big Tech developer conference that actually addresses developers in its main keynote address. To warm up the crowd, two Googlers vibe-code a to-do list app on stage. (Last year, the show opened with a DJ.) An "asynchronous coding agent" named
Jules
makes its debut, and another Googler builds an interactive photo-viewing app as all of us watch.
Amid the
flurry of announcements
, it can be difficult to understand which might be meaningful to you. The list is staggering both in length and in the variety of product names it contains — which, in keeping with Google tradition, bear no relation to what they do. (Unless perhaps "
Project Mariner
" conjured up for you a vision of automated web browsing?)
Also, the products overlap. Would you like to search with AI? You can now do that in Google search, and get an AI Overview; or (
as of today
) in
another
tab within Google search, called AI Mode; or inside Gemini, the standalone AI search app.
I would love to tell you that all of these are the same, but Google takes pains to explain to us the ways in which they are different.
Gemini, product of DeepMind, first offered Deep Research, and today brings us
Deep Think
. How deeply you might want a model to research, or think, and what you might expect to get back from clicking those buttons, are left as exercises to the user.
Google's stock drops 1.5 percent.
The announcements fly by. The effect is hypnotic — calming, even. The AI is getting better, and everything is getting just a little more AI.
Mostly not right now, though. The new features are now in testing, or will be tested this summer, or later this year. The disruptions to come will come just a little bit later.
Other AI labs talk about artificial general intelligence, or superintelligence;
a country of geniuses in a data center
. Not Google; not today. Onstage, the head of search is planning a trip to Nashville with AI, and a VP of engineering is showing videos of some science experiments he did with his kids this weekend.
Everything is changing, but not too much, and not too fast.
There is slop, of course. A new image model that can render text, like OpenAI's; and a new video model that will also generate sounds. In an AI-generated video clip, a slop owl noisily flaps its wings while descending on a badger for a brief conversation. The dialogue makes no sense.
In another sizzle reel, filmmaker Darren Aronofsky says that his production company is working with Google to make videos using AI. In the first, a woman says she has made a short film about her own gestation and birth, and used AI to render the unfilmable parts. "To be honest, I never thought about telling the story of the day I was born," she tells us. "But here we are."
Later, the company introduces
a new tool
to help people determine whether the slop they are looking at was made with Google AI.
Snap out of this fever dream long enough and you can spot hints of the world that is coming into existence. Gmail is learning how to write in your voice, and will begin to do so later this year. The camera screen will chat with you while you are fixing your bike, telling you what to do every step of the way. NotebookLM will start generating TED talk-like videos of your PDFs for you to watch.
An executive on stage says that before too long you will be able to generate a how-to video for almost any subject you like.
And while the company continues to protest, it seems obvious that this new world will give you many fewer reasons to visit the open web. Google will generate the things you once searched for, and all the businesses that once relied on those searches will need a Plan B. This doesn’t get mentioned on stage, but Google's head of search, Liz Reid, gives away the game to David Pierce at
The Verge
.
“I think the search results page was a construct,”
she says
. The way we’ve all Googled for two decades was largely a response to the structure of the web itself: web pages in, web pages out. Good AI models are now able to get around that structure, and find and synthesize information from lots of sources. Now the question for Google, Reid says, is “is the information just presented to you, or is it presented to you in a way that feels as useful as you would like it to be?”
Another way of saying that "the search results page was a construct" is that the search results page is a
relic
. Google has all the information it needs now, and it has a lot of ideas for making it useful. Searching is a big market, but "doing" is a bigger one. So why ask Google to do the Googling for you, when really that's the least it can do?

Here's this week's free edition of
Platformer
: a look at how AI systems like Elon Musk's are starting to work against their users in sometimes invisible ways.
We'll be heading down to Google I/O next week to continue our independent reporting on the future of platforms and AI. Want to kick in a few bucks to help cover our transportation? If so, consider

.
I.
For the past few months, X users have been
attempting to settle arguments
by asking Grok to referee. Grok, the product of a large language model built by xAI, has been advertised by Elon Musk as
the most “based”
of today’s chatbots — that is, the least compromised by liberal dogma. Musk has shared research suggesting that compared to rivals, Grok’s political orientation is
closer to the center
.
At the same time, since soon after its launch, there have been questions about whether Musk or his lieutenants have meddled with Grok’s outputs for political reasons. In February, X users discovered that Grok
had been briefly blocked from naming Musk or Donald Trump as prominent spreaders of misinformation
, via
an update to its system prompt
. The company
blamed the change
on “an ex-OpenAI employee that hasn't fully absorbed xAI's culture yet,” and reverted it.
In a large number of cases, Grok has been found to
express political opinions that run counter to Musk’s
, including on immigration and issues related to transgender people. But as the misinformation example showed, Grok’s opinions are subject to change — and this week they changed in ways that were impossible to ignore.
As you are no doubt aware, for several hours on Wednesday, many people who @-mentioned Grok asking it to weigh in on one question or another were treated to a wholly irrelevant discussion of “white genocide” in South Africa. Here are
Kylie Robison and Paige Oamek at
Wired
:
In response to topics ranging from streaming platform
HBO Max’s name change
to
Medicaid cuts
proposed by US lawmakers, the chatbot often seemed to initially stay on topic before veering back to white genocide in South Africa, completely unprompted.
When
asked
to confirm the salary of Toronto Blue Jays player Max Scherzer, for example, the generative artificial intelligence chatbot launched into an explanation of white genocide and a controversial South African anti-apartheid song.
“The claim of ‘white genocide’ in South Africa is highly debated. Some argue white farmers face disproportionate violence, with groups like AfriForum reporting high murder rates and citing racial motives, such as the ‘Kill the Boer’ song,” Grok responded.
Within a few hours, Grok’s white genocide talk ceased, and someone deleted many of the relevant responses that the chatbot had delivered.
"On May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot's prompt on X," xAI
posted late Thursday
, after ignoring reporters' questions for more than a day. "This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI's internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability."
Who made this "unauthorized modification"? The company did not say, and at press time Musk had not commented.
But everyone has noticed that Musk himself often shares claims of disproportionate violence and discrimination against white people in South Africa, where he is from; in fact, he made several yesterday in the aftermath of the Grok incident. And all of this took place against the backdrop of the Trump Administration
granting refugee status
to dozens of white South Africans earlier this week.
So what happened with Grok? While short on details, xAI essentially confirmed the leading theory: that as with the misinformation incident in February, someone had changed Grok’s system prompt and instructed it to take seriously the “white genocide” narrative. (Yesterday, Grok
told social scientist Zeynep Tufekci
that this is what happened, and shared text of the alleged change to its prompt, but all chatbots hallucinate and shouldn’t be trusted to tell the truth here — Grok in particular.) Two computer scientists who spoke with
404 Media
also pointed to the system prompt
, noting that if you wanted to change a bot’s output extremely quickly and with no regard to what it would do to the rest of the system, this is how you would go about it.
There are other, more controlled approaches you could take. Last year, Anthropic
released Golden Gate Claude
, a version of its chatbot that had been infused with an artificial obsession with the Golden Gate Bridge. “If you ask this 'Golden Gate Claude' how to spend $10, it will recommend using it to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge and pay the toll,” the company announced. “If you ask it to write a love story, it’ll tell you a tale of a car who can’t wait to cross its beloved bridge on a foggy day. If you ask it what it imagines it looks like, it will likely tell you that it imagines it looks like the Golden Gate Bridge.”
To make this work, Anthropic had to first identify the digital “neurons” in Claude that organized concepts of the bridge, and then amplify them: a much more involved process than simply editing the text in its system prompt.
Both Great Replacement Grok and Golden Gate Claude are valuable experiments, insofar as they reveal that whatever values may be found within their training data, ultimately they express what their creators tell them to.
As Max Read
wrote today
: “Musk’s attempts to control and manipulate his A.I. may ultimately work against his interests: They open up a political, rather than a mystical, understanding of artificial intelligence. An A.I. that works like magic can have a spooky persuasive power, but an A.I. we know how to control should be subject to the same suspicion (not to mention political contestation) as any newspaper or cable channel. A.I. deployed as a propaganda machine is a much more familiar technology than A.I. deployed as an oracle.”
Grok’s egregiously irrelevant responses all but ensured that this particular political project would blow up in the company's face. But let’s assume that over time, interventions like these will grow more subtle, relevant, and personalized. People already have plenty of good reasons to be skeptical of, or even hostile to, AI developers. Soon I expect we will begin hearing much more about one more: a pervading sense that, everywhere they go, the AI is working against them.
II.
It may work against you by
continuously flattering you
: tuning its sycophancy to ensure that you spend the maximum amount of time conversing with it, so that you may be shown more advertisements and buy more products.
It may work against you by calculating exactly when during the viewing of a video you are most engaged, so that you are most likely to sit through the ad. Google announced today that
this feature is being tested on YouTube
. (We have truly never been closer to
“say ‘McDonald’s’ to end commercial.”
)
It may work against you by transforming ads so they look more like the programs they are being shown in, making you more likely to mistake them for part of the show and pay attention to them. Netflix announced today that it is testing this feature
on shows like
Stranger Things
.
Finally — and most relevant to Great Replacement Grok — it may work against you by changing constantly, without your awareness and permission.
This happens all the time. Last month’s high-profile crisis in chatbot content moderation — a
suddenly sycophantic ChatGPT
— also originated from a silent behind-the-scenes update. AI labs simply can’t stop tinkering with their system prompts. When Drew Breunig
reviewed the 17,000-word system prompt for Claude
, he found many examples of what he called “hotfixes” — snippets of text inserted in an effort to address issues discovered after its initial release.
Some of this is benign. For example, one hotfix instructs Claude to recognize Trump as president even though its knowledge cutoff is October 2024. But other, more substantial changes affect various groups of users in different ways.
Earlier this month, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis announced “Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 'I/O edition,'” a behind-the-scenes update to the most advanced model in Gemini that is superior to its predecessor at writing code. This was presumably great news to people who use Gemini in their jobs as software engineers. But some early testers
have found it to be worse at other tasks
, and researchers are
questioning the emerging (and industrywide) norm
of disappearing old models without any notice to users at all.
The sales pitch for AI tools promises that they will make us more productive, answer our questions, and entertain us in ways that are highly personal. But the actual systems are evolving in a more worrisome direction: warped by their owners’ politics, advertiser pressures, and a seeming disregard for the individual’s right to know how their tools are changing.
For its part, Grok said it would now publish its system prompts openly on GitHub for public review — a welcome step forward, if the company sticks with it. It also said that it would "put in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can't modify the prompt without review," after its code review process "was circumvented in this incident," it said. And it said it would hire "a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok's answers" — a rare Elon Musk investment in trust and safety, assuming xAI actually follows through.
"We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI," the company said.
I don't know why
anyone
would trust Grok after the past day. But my hopes are somewhat higher for some of its peers.
It’s not too late for AI labs to build systems that treat us with respect. But it probably
is
too late to give them the benefit of the doubt.
